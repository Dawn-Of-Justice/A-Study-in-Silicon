It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us. And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,\u2014we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan\u2019s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto\u2019s death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan\u2019s chart,\u2014here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue. Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window. \u201cGo on, you drunken vagabone,\u201d said the face. \u201cIf you kick up any more row I\u2019ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019ll let one out it\u2019s just what I have come for,\u201d said I. \u201cGo on!\u201d yelled the voice. \u201cSo help me gracious, I have a wiper in the bag, an\u2019 I\u2019ll drop it on your \u2019ead if you don\u2019t hook it.\u201d \u201cBut I want a dog,\u201d I cried. \u201cI won\u2019t be argued with!\u201d shouted Mr. Sherman. \u201cNow stand clear, for when I say \u2018three,\u2019 down goes the wiper.\u201d \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes\u2014\u201d I began, but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses. \u201cA friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\u201d said he. \u201cStep in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?\u201d This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. \u201cDon\u2019t mind that, sir: it\u2019s only a slow-worm. It hain\u2019t got no fangs, so I gives it the run o\u2019 the room, for it keeps the beetles down.

What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\u201d \u201cHe wanted a dog of yours.\u201d \u201cAh! that would be Toby.\u201d \u201cYes, Toby was the name.\u201d \u201cToby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\u201d He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers. Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsy waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective\u2019s name. Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe. \u201cAh, you have him there!\u201d said he. \u201cGood dog, then! Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant upstairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\u201d We tied Toby to the hall table, and re-ascended the stairs. The room was as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner. \u201cLend me your bull\u2019s-eye, sergeant,\u201d said my companion. \u201cNow tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.\u2014Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment.\u201d We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust. \u201cI wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you observe anything noteworthy about them?\u201d \u201cThey belong,\u201d I said, \u201cto a child or a small woman.\u201d \u201cApart from their size, though.

Is there nothing else?\u201d \u201cThey appear to be much as other footmarks.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?\u201d \u201cYour toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe distinctly divided.\u201d \u201cQuite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\u201d I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell. \u201cThat is where he put his foot in getting out. If _you_ can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run downstairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\u201d By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves. \u201cThat you, Watson?\u201d he cried. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThis is the place. What is that black thing down there?\u201d \u201cA water-barrel.\u201d \u201cTop on it?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNo sign of a ladder?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cConfound the fellow! It\u2019s a most break-neck place. I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm. Here goes, anyhow.\u201d There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth. \u201cIt was easy to follow him,\u201d he said, drawing on his stockings and boots. \u201cTiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\u201d The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto. \u201cThey are hellish things,\u201d said he. \u201cLook out that you don\u2019t prick yourself.

Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered. \u201cYour leg will stand it?\u201d \u201cOh, yes.\u201d \u201cHere you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!\u201d He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog\u2019s nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel\u2019s collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed. The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold grey light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it. On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side. \u201cThere\u2019s the print of wooden-leg\u2019s hand,\u201d he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. \u201cYou see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours\u2019 start.\u201d I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents. \u201cDo not imagine,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}

I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.\u201d \u201cThere is credit, and to spare,\u201d said I. \u201cI assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?\u201d \u201cPshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don\u2019t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan\u2019s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates,\u2014the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers\u2014or one of them\u2014gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.\u201d \u201cBut that is mere speculation,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?\u201d \u201cA letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\u201d \u201cOr had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,\u2014a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\u2019s name is on the chart.", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}

He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,\u2014a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\u2019s name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?\u201d \u201cNo: it is clear and concise.\u201d \u201cWell, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man\u2019s window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?\u201d \u201cVery clearly.\u201d \u201cNow, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.\u201d \u201cBut it was the associate, and", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}

And rather to Jonathan\u2019s disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don\u2019t know that there is anything else.\u201d \u201cThe associate?\u201d \u201cAh, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\u201d \u201cFairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.\u201d \u201cThat was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man\u2019s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?\u201d \u201cI have my stick.\u201d \u201cIt is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair.

Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.\u201d He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket. We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where labourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent. We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight\u2019s Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment. \u201cWhat the deuce is the matter with the dog?\u201d growled Holmes. \u201cThey surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\u201d \u201cPerhaps they stood here for some time,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAh! it\u2019s all right. He\u2019s off again,\u201d said my companion, in a tone of relief. He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run. I could see by the gleam in Holmes\u2019s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey. Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson\u2019s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work.

With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote.

It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.\u201d \u201cWe must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight\u2019s Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other.\u201d There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction. \u201cWe must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from,\u201d I observed. \u201cI had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the true scent now.\u201d It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince\u2019s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water\u2019s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond. \u201cWe are out of luck,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey have taken to a boat here.\u201d Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign. Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. \u201cMordecai Smith\u201d was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, \u201cBoats to hire by the hour or day.\u201d A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept,\u2014a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression. \u201cThis looks bad,\u201d said he. \u201cThese fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.\u201d He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand. \u201cYou come back and be washed, Jack,\u201d she shouted. \u201cCome back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he\u2019ll let us hear of it.\u201d \u201cDear little chap!\u201d said Holmes, strategically. \u201cWhat a rosy-cheeked young rascal!

He gets a\u2019most too much for me to manage, \u2019specially when my man is away days at a time.\u201d \u201cAway, is he?\u201d said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. \u201cI am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been away since yesterday mornin\u2019, sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginnin\u2019 to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.\u201d \u201cI wanted to hire his steam launch.\u201d \u201cWhy, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. That\u2019s what puzzles me; for I know there ain\u2019t more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he\u2019d been away in the barge I\u2019d ha\u2019 thought nothin\u2019; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin\u2019 there he might ha\u2019 stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?\u201d \u201cHe might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\u201d \u201cHe might, sir, but it weren\u2019t his way. Many a time I\u2019ve heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don\u2019t like that wooden-legged man, wi\u2019 his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin\u2019 about here for?\u201d \u201cA wooden-legged man?\u201d said Holmes, with bland surprise. \u201cYes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that\u2019s called more\u2019n once for my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what\u2019s more, my man knew he was comin\u2019, for he had steam up in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don\u2019t feel easy in my mind about it.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear Mrs. Smith,\u201d said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cYou are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don\u2019t quite understand how you can be so sure.\u201d \u201cHis voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o\u2019 thick and foggy. He tapped at the winder,\u2014about three it would be. \u2018Show a leg, matey,\u2019 says he: \u2018time to turn out guard.\u2019 My old man woke up Jim,\u2014that\u2019s my eldest,\u2014and away they went, without so much as a word to me.

Black with a white band.\u201d \u201cAh, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs. Smith.\u2014There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it and cross the river. \u201cThe main thing with people of that sort,\u201d said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, \u201cis never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\u201d \u201cOur course now seems pretty clear,\u201d said I. \u201cWhat would you do, then?\u201d \u201cI would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the _Aurora_.\u201d \u201cMy dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.\u201d \u201cEmploy the police, then.\u201d \u201cNo. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.\u201d \u201cCould we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\u201d \u201cWorse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. Jones\u2019s energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do, then?\u201d I asked,", "chapter": "VIII\nThe Baker Street Irregulars"}

It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet.\u201d We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes despatched his wire. \u201cWhom do you think that is to?\u201d he asked, as we resumed our journey. \u201cI am sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cYou remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, laughing. \u201cThis is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\u201d It was between eight and nine o\u2019clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure. A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper. \u201cThe energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham and eggs first.\u201d I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed \u201cMysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\u201d \u201cAbout twelve o\u2019clock last night,\u201d said the _Standard_, \u201cMr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point", "chapter": "VIII\nThe Baker Street Irregulars"}

As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\u2019s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones\u2019s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it gorgeous!\u201d said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d \u201cI think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.\u201d \u201cSo do I. I wouldn\u2019t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy.\u201d At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay. \u201cBy heaven, Holmes,\u201d I said, half rising, \u201cI believe that they are really after us.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not quite so bad as that.

There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow. \u201cGot your message, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cand brought \u2019em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.\u201d \u201cHere you are,\u201d said Holmes, producing some silver. \u201cIn future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the _Aurora_, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith\u2019s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?\u201d \u201cYes, guv\u2019nor,\u201d said Wiggins. \u201cThe old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here\u2019s a day in advance. Now off you go!\u201d He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street. \u201cIf the launch is above water they will find her,\u201d said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe. \u201cThey can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. In the meanwhile, we can do nothing but await results. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the _Aurora_ or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\u201d \u201cToby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed, Holmes?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.\u201d \u201cThat other man again!\u201d \u201cI have no wish to make a mystery of him,\u2014to you, anyway.

What do you make of all this?\u201d \u201cA savage!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cPerhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small.\u201d \u201cHardly that,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our savage?\u201d \u201cSouth American,\u201d I hazarded. He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf. \u201cThis is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here? \u2018Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay of Bengal.\u2019 Hum! hum! What\u2019s all this? Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods\u2014Ah, here we are. \u2018The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.\u2019 Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen to this. \u2018They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.\u2019 Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him.\u201d \u201cBut how came he to have so singular a companion?\u201d \u201cAh, that is more than I can tell.

Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\u201d He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,\u2014his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation.

Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book.

I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.\u201d \u201cCan I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night\u2019s outing.\u201d \u201cNo, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.\u201d \u201cThen I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester. She asked me to, yesterday.\u201d \u201cOn Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\u201d asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes. \u201cWell, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what happened.\u201d \u201cI would not tell them too much,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWomen are never to be entirely trusted,\u2014not the best of them.\u201d I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. \u201cI shall be back in an hour or two,\u201d I remarked. \u201cAll right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don\u2019t think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now.\u201d I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist\u2019s in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night\u2019s adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto\u2019s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them. \u201cIt is a romance!\u201d cried Mrs. Forrester. \u201cAn injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\u201d \u201cAnd two knight-errants to the rescue,\u201d added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me. \u201cWhy, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search.

On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest. \u201cIt is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge.\u201d It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home. My companion\u2019s book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none. \u201cI suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\u201d I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds. \u201cNo, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,\u201d sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, \u201cI am afraid for his health?\u201d \u201cWhy so, Mrs. Hudson?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep.

I hope he\u2019s not going to be ill, sir.

At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish colour upon either cheek. \u201cYou are knocking yourself up, old man,\u201d I remarked. \u201cI heard you marching about in the night.\u201d \u201cNo, I could not sleep,\u201d he answered. \u201cThis infernal problem is consuming me.

I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.\u201d \u201cCould it have gone up the river?\u201d \u201cI have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear something.\u201d We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment. In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck. \u201cI am off down the river, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cI have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events.\u201d \u201cSurely I can come with you, then?\u201d said I. \u201cNo; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?\u201d \u201cMost certainly.\u201d \u201cI am afraid that you will not be", "chapter": "IX\nA Break in the Chain"}

If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back.\u201d I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the _Standard_, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business. \u201cWith reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\u201d it remarked, \u201cwe have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.\u201d \u201cThat is satisfactory so far as it goes,\u201d thought I. \u201cFriend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\u201d I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way: \u201cLost.\u2014Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith\u2019s Wharf at or about three o\u2019clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch _Aurora_, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith\u2019s Wharf, or at 221_b_ Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch _Aurora_.\u201d This was clearly Holmes\u2019s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband. It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing.

I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion\u2019s reasoning. Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic,\u2014his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes\u2019s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally _outr\u00e9_ and startling. At three o\u2019clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic. \u201cGood-day, sir; good-day,\u201d said he. \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.\u201d \u201cYes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\u201d \u201cThank you; I don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d said he, mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief. \u201cAnd a whiskey-and-soda?\u201d \u201cWell, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case?\u201d \u201cI remember that you expressed one.\u201d \u201cWell, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he left his brother\u2019s room he was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. It\u2019s a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.\u201d \u201cWe all need help sometimes,\u201d said I. \u201cYour friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\u201d said he, in a husky and confidential voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a man who is not to be beat.

I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I don\u2019t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message.\u201d He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was dated from Poplar at twelve o\u2019clock. \u201cGo to Baker Street at once,\u201d it said. \u201cIf I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.\u201d \u201cThis sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,\u201d said I. \u201cAh, then he has been at fault too,\u201d exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. \u201cEven the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door. Perhaps this is he.\u201d A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long grey side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty. \u201cWhat is it, my man?\u201d I asked. He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age. \u201cIs Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\u201d said he. \u201cNo; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for him.\u201d \u201cIt was to him himself I was to tell it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut I tell you that I am acting for him.

If Mr. Holmes ain\u2019t here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I don\u2019t care about the look of either of you, and I won\u2019t tell a word.\u201d He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him. \u201cWait a bit, my friend,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have important information, and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.\u201d The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognised the uselessness of resistance. \u201cPretty sort o\u2019 treatment this!\u201d he cried, stamping his stick. \u201cI come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!\u201d \u201cYou will be none the worse,\u201d I said. \u201cWe shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.\u201d He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk. Suddenly, however, Holmes\u2019s voice broke in upon us. \u201cI think that you might offer me a cigar too,\u201d he said. We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement. \u201cHolmes!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cYou here! But where is the old man?\u201d \u201cHere is the old man,\u201d said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \u201cHere he is,\u2014wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\u201d \u201cAh, You rogue!\u201d cried Jones, highly delighted. \u201cYou would have made an actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week. I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though.

You got my wire?\u201d \u201cYes; that was what brought me here.\u201d \u201cHow has your case prospered?\u201d \u201cIt has all come to nothing.

The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.\u201d \u201cCertainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?\u201d \u201cWell, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don\u2019t see how I can refuse you an interview with him.\u201d \u201cThat is understood, then?\u201d \u201cPerfectly. Is there anything else?\u201d \u201cOnly that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half an hour.

{"text": "Chapter X The End of the Islander Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects,\u2014on miracle-plays, on medi\u00e6val pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future,\u2014handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a _bon vivant_. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes\u2019s gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together. When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port. \u201cOne bumper,\u201d said he, \u201cto the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?\u201d \u201cI have my old service-revolver in my desk.\u201d \u201cYou had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.\u201d It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically. \u201cIs there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\u201d \u201cYes,\u2014that green lamp at the side.\u201d \u201cThen take it off.\u201d The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward. \u201cWhere to?\u201d asked Jones. \u201cTo the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson\u2019s Yard.\u201d Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us. \u201cWe ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.\u201d \u201cWe shall have to catch the _Aurora_, and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is.

{"text": "our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces,\u2014though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time\u2014as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge\u2014he could hardly leave at a moment\u2019s notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me to be a little weak,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition.\u201d \u201cNo, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o\u2019clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.\u201d \u201cBut the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\u201d \u201cQuite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would.

He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might hand the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours\u2019 notice.\u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough.\u201d \u201cIt is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman\u2019s rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth\u2014Jacobson\u2019s\u2014I learned that the _Aurora_ had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. \u2018There ain\u2019t naught amiss with her rudder,\u2019 said the foreman. \u2018There she lies, with the red streaks.\u2019 At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. \u2018I want her to-night at eight o\u2019clock,\u2019 said he,\u2014\u2018eight o\u2019clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won\u2019t be kept waiting.\u2019 They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water\u2019s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\u201d \u201cYou have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,\u201d said Jones; \u201cbut if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson\u2019s Yard, and arrested them when they came down.\u201d \u201cWhich would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week.\u201d \u201cBut you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,\u201d said I. \u201cIn that case I should have wasted my day.

I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\u201d While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul\u2019s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower. \u201cThat is Jacobson\u2019s Yard,\u201d said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side. \u201cCruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters.\u201d He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \u201cI see my sentry at his post,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut no sign of a handkerchief.\u201d \u201cSuppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\u201d said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward. \u201cWe have no right to take anything for granted,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight.\u201d \u201cThey are coming from work in the yard.\u201d \u201cDirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at them. There is no _a priori_ probability about it. A strange enigma is man!\u201d \u201cSome one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWinwood Reade is good upon the subject,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief?

By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!\u201d She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head. \u201cShe is very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt if we shall catch her.\u201d \u201cWe _must_ catch her!\u201d cried Holmes, between his teeth. \u201cHeap it on, stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have them!\u201d We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp, steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the _Aurora_ lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the _Aurora_ thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track. \u201cPile it on, men, pile it on!\u201d cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. \u201cGet every pound of steam you can.\u201d \u201cI think we gain a little,\u201d said Jones, with his eyes on the _Aurora_. \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said I. \u201cWe shall be up with her in a very few minutes.\u201d At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the _Aurora_ had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs.

We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty _Aurora_. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat\u2019s lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man\u2014the smallest I have ever seen\u2014with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night.

Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury. \u201cFire if he raises his hand,\u201d said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat\u2019s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern. It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The _Aurora_ herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos.

There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores. \u201cSee here,\u201d said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. \u201cWe were hardly quick enough with our pistols.\u201d There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired.

{"text": "Chapter XI The Great Agra Treasure Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes. \u201cWell, Jonathan Small,\u201d said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \u201cI am sorry that it has come to this.\u201d \u201cAnd so am I, sir,\u201d he answered, frankly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.\u201d \u201cHave a cigar,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cand you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?\u201d \u201cYou seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it\u2019s cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.\u201d \u201cYou are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard.

He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.\u201d \u201cThat he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I\u2019d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don\u2019t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,\u201d he added, with a bitter smile, \u201cthat I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\u201d At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. \u201cQuite a family party,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn\u2019t take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.\u201d \u201cAll is well that ends well,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBut I certainly did not know that the _Aurora_ was such a clipper.\u201d \u201cSmith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\u201d \u201cNeither he did,\u201d cried our prisoner,\u2014\u201cnot a word. I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier.

If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them.\u201d It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes\u2019s face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him. \u201cWe will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\u201d said Jones, \u201cand shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?\u201d \u201cYes, I shall drive.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?\u201d \u201cAt the bottom of the river,\u201d said Small, shortly. \u201cHum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.\u201d They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour\u2019s drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester\u2019s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab. She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks. \u201cI heard a cab drive up,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might", "chapter": "XI\nThe Great Agra Treasure"}

What news have you brought me?\u201d \u201cI have brought something better than news,\u201d said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me. \u201cI have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.\u201d She glanced at the iron box. \u201cIs that the treasure, then?\u201d she asked, coolly enough. \u201cYes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto\u2019s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?\u201d I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously. \u201cIf I have it,\u201d said she, \u201cI owe it to you.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d I answered, \u201cnot to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.\u201d \u201cPray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\u201d said she. I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last,\u2014Holmes\u2019s new method of search, the discovery of the _Aurora_, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint. \u201cIt is nothing,\u201d she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. \u201cI am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.\u201d \u201cThat is all over,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\u201d \u201cIt would be of the greatest interest to me,\u201d she said. There was no eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win. \u201cWhat a pretty box!\u201d she said, stooping over it. \u201cThis", "chapter": "XI\nThe Great Agra Treasure"}

Where is the key?\u201d \u201cSmall threw it into the Thames,\u201d I answered. \u201cI must borrow Mrs. Forrester\u2019s poker.\u201d There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty! No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely empty. \u201cThe treasure is lost,\u201d said Miss Morstan, calmly. As I listened to the words and realised what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realise nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. \u201cThank God!\u201d I ejaculated from my very heart. She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause you are within my reach again,\u201d I said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it. \u201cBecause I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d \u201cThen I say, \u2018Thank God,\u2019 too,\u201d she whispered, as I drew her to my side.

{"text": "Chapter XII The Strange Story of Jonathan Small A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box. \u201cThere goes the reward!\u201d said he, gloomily. \u201cWhere there is no money there is no pay. This night\u2019s work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\u201d \u201cMr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\u201d I said. \u201cHe will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no.\u201d The inspector shook his head despondently, however. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad job,\u201d he repeated; \u201cand so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\u201d His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud. \u201cThis is your doing, Small,\u201d said Athelney Jones, angrily. \u201cYes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cIt is my treasure; and if I can\u2019t have the loot I\u2019ll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It\u2019s been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You\u2019ll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.\u201d \u201cYou are deceiving us, Small,\u201d said Athelney Jones, sternly. \u201cIf you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.\u201d \u201cEasier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\u201d he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look. \u201cThe man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river.

Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga\u2019s darts in my hide, than live in a convict\u2019s cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.\u201d Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track. \u201cYou forget that we know nothing of all this,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cWe have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.\u201d \u201cWell, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is God\u2019s truth, every word of it.

I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well-known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen\u2019s shilling and joining the 3rd Buffs, which was just starting for India. \u201cI wasn\u2019t destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation. \u201cI was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abel White, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened to be a friend of our colonel\u2019s, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting.

Mr. Abel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home. \u201cWell, I was never in luck\u2019s way long. Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,\u2014a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson\u2019s wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abel White\u2019s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head;", "chapter": "XII\nThe Strange Story of Jonathan Small"}

From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra. \u201cAs it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city. \u201cNothing but the worst news came to us from every side,\u2014which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage. \u201cThe city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don\u2019t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place,\u2014the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it.

For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring. \u201cThe river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack. \u201cWell, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well. \u201cThe third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain.

It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step. \u201cMy first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered, \u2018Don\u2019t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.\u2019 There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow\u2019s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me. \u201c\u2018Listen to me, Sahib,\u2019 said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. \u2018You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.\u2019 \u201c\u2018How can I decide?\u2019 said I. \u2018You have not told me what you want of me.

We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But what is the treasure, then?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.\u2019 \u201c\u2018You will swear, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018by the bones of your father, by the honour of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?\u2019 \u201c\u2018I will swear it,\u2019 I answered, \u2018provided that the fort is not endangered.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.\u2019 \u201c\u2018There are but three,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say. \u201c\u2018There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,\u2014with the Sepoy and with the Company\u2019s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men\u2019s day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him.

Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt. \u201c\u2018This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming. The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, Sahib?\u2019 \u201cIn Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne\u2019er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely. \u201c\u2018Consider, Sahib,\u2019 said he, \u2018that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company\u2019s coffers.

Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I am with you heart and soul,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018It is well,\u2019 he answered, handing me back my firelock. \u2018You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh.\u2019 \u201cThe rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death. \u201cSuddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction. \u201c\u2018Here they are!\u2019 I exclaimed. \u201c\u2018You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,\u2019 whispered Abdullah. \u2018Give him no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.\u2019 \u201cThe light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them. \u201c\u2018Who goes there?\u2019 said I, in a subdued voice. \u201c\u2018Friends,\u2019 came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl.

It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me. \u201c\u2018Your protection, Sahib,\u2019 he panted,\u2014\u2018your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,\u2014I and my poor possessions.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What have you in the bundle?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018An iron box,\u2019 he answered, \u2018which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.\u2019 \u201cI could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over. \u201c\u2018Take him to the main guard,\u2019 said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gateway. Never was a man so compassed round with death. I remained at the gateway with the lantern. \u201cI could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet.

I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.\u201d He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded. \u201cIt was all very bad, no doubt,\u201d said he. \u201cI should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.\u201d \u201cGo on with your story,\u201d said Holmes, shortly. \u201cWell, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure. \u201cIt lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was the same which now lies open upon your table.

A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, \u2018the Great Mogul\u2019 and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats\u2019-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it. \u201cAfter we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny.

In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet. \u201cIt came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,\u2014three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others. \u201cIt was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up.

It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time. \u201cAt last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away. \u201cThe surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little party they used to make. \u201cWell, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don\u2019t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other\u2019s game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow.

These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other\u2019s game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him. \u201cOne night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. The major was raving about his losses. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s all up, Morstan,\u2019 he was saying, as they passed my hut. \u2018I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nonsense, old chap!\u2019 said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. \u2018I\u2019ve had a nasty facer myself, but\u2014\u2019 That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking. \u201cA couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him. \u201c\u2018I wish to have your advice, major,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018Well, Small, what is it?\u2019 he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips. \u201c\u2018I wanted to ask you, sir,\u2019 said I, \u2018who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Half a million, Small?\u2019 he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest. \u201c\u2018Quite that, sir,\u2014in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.\u2019 \u201c\u2018To government, Small,\u2019 he stammered,\u2014\u2018to government.\u2019 But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him. \u201c\u2018You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?\u2019 said I, quietly. \u201c\u2018Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.

When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him. \u201c\u2018This is a very important matter, Small,\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.\u2019 \u201cTwo nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern. \u201c\u2018I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,\u2019 said he. \u201cI repeated it as I had told it before. \u201c\u2018It rings true, eh?\u2019 said he. \u2018It\u2019s good enough to act upon?\u2019 \u201cCaptain Morstan nodded. \u201c\u2018Look here, Small,\u2019 said the major. \u2018We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.\u2019 He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed. \u201c\u2018Why, as to that, gentlemen,\u2019 I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, \u2018there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Hum!\u2019 said he. \u2018A fifth share! That is not very tempting.\u2019 \u201c\u2018It would come to fifty thousand apiece,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an impossibility.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nothing of the sort,\u2019 I answered. \u2018I have thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.\u2019 \u201c\u2018If there were only one,\u2019 he said. \u201c\u2018None or all,\u2019 I answered. \u2018We have sworn it.

I think we may very well trust him.\u2019 \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a dirty business,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Well, Small,\u2019 said the major, \u2018we must, I suppose, try and meet you. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Not so fast,\u2019 said I, growing colder as he got hot. \u2018I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 he broke in. \u2018What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Black or blue,\u2019 said I, \u2018they are in with me, and we all go together.\u2019 \u201cWell, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major\u2019s share as well as his own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,\u2014that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself. \u201cWell, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I\u2019ll make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again.

Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law,\u2014nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,\u2014that was my one thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto. \u201cWell, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came. I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me. \u201cTonga\u2014for that was his name\u2014was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes. \u201cHe was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,\u2014a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island.

I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions. \u201cWell, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at night. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realised the treasure, or if he still had it. I made friends with someone who could help me,\u2014I name no names, for I don\u2019t want to get any one else in a hole,\u2014and I soon found that he still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him. \u201cOne day, however, I got word that he was dying.

I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him. I\u2019d have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled. \u201cWe earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day\u2019s work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto\u2019s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto\u2019s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope\u2019s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp.

Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope\u2019s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith\u2019s launch the _Aurora_, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,\u2014for you have not done me a very good turn,\u2014but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\u201d \u201cA very remarkable account,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cA fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\u201d \u201cHe had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.\u201d \u201cAh, of course,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI had not thought of that.\u201d \u201cIs there any other point which you would like to ask about?\u201d asked the convict, affably. \u201cI think not, thank you,\u201d my companion answered. \u201cWell, Holmes,\u201d said Athelney Jones, \u201cYou are a man to be humoured, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me.

I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\u201d \u201cI trust,\u201d said I, laughing, \u201cthat my judgment may survive the ordeal.

He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap. \u201cIt is Porlock\u2019s writing,\u201d said he thoughtfully. \u201cI can hardly doubt that it is Porlock\u2019s writing, though I have seen it only twice before.

But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.\u201d He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened. \u201cWho then is Porlock?\u201d I asked. \u201cPorlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal with the lion\u2014anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister\u2014in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?\u201d \u201cThe famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as\u2014\u201d \u201cMy blushes, Watson!\u201d Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice. \u201cI was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.\u201d \u201cA touch! A distinct touch!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cYou are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law\u2014and there lie the glory and the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations\u2014that\u2019s the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year\u2019s pension as a solatium for his wounded character.

Is this a man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor\u2014such would be your respective r\u00f4les! That\u2019s genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser men, our day will surely come.\u201d \u201cMay I be there to see!\u201d I exclaimed devoutly. \u201cBut you were speaking of this man Porlock.\u201d \u201cAh, yes\u2014the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link\u2014between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it.\u201d \u201cBut no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\u201d \u201cExactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value\u2014that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate.\u201d Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as follows: 534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE 26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171 \u201cWhat do you make of it, Holmes?\u201d \u201cIt is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.\u201d \u201cBut what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?\u201d \u201cIn this instance, none at all.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say \u2018in this instance\u2019?\u201d \u201cBecause there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless.\u201d \u201cBut why \u2018Douglas\u2019 and \u2018Birlstone\u2019?\u201d \u201cClearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question.\u201d \u201cThen why has he not indicated the book?\u201d \u201cYour native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it.

I fear, Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm. \u201c\u2018Dear Mr. Holmes,\u2019 he says, \u2018I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous\u2014he suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you. \u201c\u2018FRED PORLOCK.\u2019\u201d Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he said at last, \u201cthere may be nothing in it. It may be only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read the accusation in the other\u2019s eyes.\u201d \u201cThe other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.\u201d \u201cNo less! When any of that party talk about \u2018He\u2019 you know whom they mean. There is one predominant \u2018He\u2019 for all of them.\u201d \u201cBut what can he do?\u201d \u201cHum! That\u2019s a large question. When you have one of the first brains of Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back, there are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently scared out of his senses\u2014kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.\u201d \u201cWhy did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?\u201d \u201cBecause he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case, and possibly bring trouble on him.\u201d \u201cNo doubt,\u201d said I. \u201cOf course.\u201d I had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it.\u201d Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. \u201cI wonder!\u201d said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling.", "chapter": "I\nThe Warning"}

Let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man\u2019s reference is to a book. That is our point of departure.\u201d \u201cA somewhat vague one.\u201d \u201cLet us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this book?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d \u201cWell, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. So our book has already become a _large_ book, which is surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of that, Watson?\u201d \u201cChapter the second, no doubt.\u201d \u201cHardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.\u201d \u201cColumn!\u201d I cried. \u201cBrilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?\u201d \u201cI fear that we have.\u201d \u201cSurely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear Watson\u2014yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it\u2014and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very common book.\u201d \u201cWhat you say certainly sounds plausible.\u201d \u201cSo we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in double columns and in common use.\u201d \u201cThe Bible!\u201d I cried triumphantly. \u201cGood, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough!

Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty\u2019s associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.\u201d \u201cBut very few books would correspond with that.\u201d \u201cExactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.\u201d \u201cBradshaw!\u201d \u201cThere are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is left?\u201d \u201cAn almanac!\u201d \u201cExcellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker\u2019s Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.\u201d He picked the volume from his desk. \u201cHere is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is \u2018Mahratta.\u2019 Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is \u2018Government\u2019; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is \u2018pig\u2019s-bristles.\u2019 We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!\u201d He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand. \u201cWe pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!\u201d he cried. \u201cWe are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is \u2018There,\u2019 which is much more promising.

If the green-grocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.\u201d I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee. \u201cWhat a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!\u201d said I. \u201cOn the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWhen you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman.

There is our result\u2014and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!\u201d Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the room. Those were the early days at the end of the \u201980\u2019s, when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent. Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him. \u201cYou are an early bird, Mr. Mac,\u201d said he.", "chapter": "I\nThe Warning"}

It would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long overstimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution. \u201cRemarkable!\u201d said he. \u201cRemarkable!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised.\u201d \u201cInterested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised? I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not surprised.\u201d In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher.

We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will follow.\u201d \u201cNo doubt, Mr. Mac.

What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?\u201d \u201cAll knowledge comes useful to the detective,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cEven the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled \u2018La Jeune Fille \u00e0 l\u2019Agneau\u2019 fetched one million two hundred thousand francs\u2014more than forty thousand pounds\u2014at the Portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind.\u201d It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested. \u201cI may remind you,\u201d Holmes continued, \u201cthat the professor\u2019s salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven hundred a year.\u201d \u201cThen how could he buy\u2014\u201d \u201cQuite so! How could he?\u201d \u201cAy, that\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said the inspector thoughtfully. \u201cTalk away, Mr. Holmes. I\u2019m just loving it. It\u2019s fine!\u201d Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration\u2014the characteristic of the real artist. \u201cWhat about Birlstone?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve time yet,\u201d said the inspector, glancing at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve a cab at the door, and it won\u2019t take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you had never met Professor Moriarty.\u201d \u201cNo, I never have.\u201d \u201cThen how do you know about his rooms?\u201d \u201cAh, that\u2019s another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came. Once\u2014well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective. It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers\u2014with the most unexpected results.\u201d \u201cYou found something compromising?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now seen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year. And he owns a Greuze.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cSurely the inference is plain.\u201d \u201cYou mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?\u201d \u201cExactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so\u2014dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation.\u201d \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it\u2019s more than interesting\u2014it\u2019s just wonderful. But let us have it a little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary\u2014where does the money come from?\u201d \u201cHave you ever read of Jonathan Wild?\u201d \u201cWell, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I don\u2019t take much stock of detectives in novels\u2014chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them. That\u2019s just inspiration: not business.\u201d \u201cJonathan Wild wasn\u2019t a detective, and he wasn\u2019t in a novel. He was a master criminal, and he lived last century\u20141750 or thereabouts.\u201d \u201cThen he\u2019s no use", "chapter": "II\nSherlock Holmes Discourses"}

I\u2019m a practical man.\u201d \u201cMr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles\u2014even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent. commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It\u2019s all been done before, and will be again. I\u2019ll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll interest me, right enough.\u201d \u201cI happen to know who is the first link in his chain\u2014a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. What do you think he pays him?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to hear.\u201d \u201cSix thousand a year. That\u2019s paying for brains, you see\u2014the American business principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It\u2019s more than the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty\u2019s gains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty\u2019s checks lately\u2014just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?\u201d \u201cQueer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?\u201d \u201cThat he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.\u201d Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand. \u201cHe can keep, anyhow,\u201d said he. \u201cYou\u2019ve got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that?\u201d \u201cWe may form some conception as to the motives of the crime.

Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that?\u201d \u201cWe may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man\u2014this Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal\u2019s subordinates\u2014had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment followed, and would be known to all\u2014if only to put the fear of death into them.\u201d \u201cWell, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.\u201d \u201cThe other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. Was there any robbery?\u201d \u201cI have not heard.\u201d \u201cIf so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him.\u201d \u201cThen to Birlstone we must go!\u201d cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair. \u201cMy word! it\u2019s later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five minutes for preparation, and that is all.\u201d \u201cAnd ample for us both,\u201d said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat. \u201cWhile we are on our way, Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.\u201d \u201cAll about it\u201d proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert\u2019s closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction. Sherlock Holmes\u2019s eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him.

Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald\u2019s short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run. \u201cDEAR INSPECTOR MACDONALD,\u201d said the letter which he read to us,\u2014\u201cOfficial requisition for your services is in separate envelope. This is for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can get for Birlstone, and I will meet it\u2014or have it met if I am too occupied. This case is a snorter. Don\u2019t waste a moment in getting started. If you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find something after his own heart. We would think the whole had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasn\u2019t a dead man in the middle of it. My word! it _is_ a snorter.\u201d \u201cYour friend seems to be no fool,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cNo, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.\u201d \u201cWell, have you anything more?\u201d \u201cOnly that he will give us every detail when we meet.\u201d \u201cThen how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered?\u201d \u201cThat was in the inclosed official report. It didn\u2019t say \u2018horrible\u2019: that\u2019s not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That\u2019s absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.\u201d \u201cThen, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession.

{"text": "Chapter III The Tragedy of Birlstone Now for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards. Only in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast. The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex. For centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around. These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population; so there seems some prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It is the centre for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of Kent. About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had been granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle. The Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond-paned windows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served the humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there, and lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth, round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditchlike or unhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water. The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants of the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted into an island during the night\u2014a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage", "chapter": "III\nThe Tragedy of Birlstone"}

By thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted into an island during the night\u2014a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all England. The house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of it. This family consisted of only two individuals\u2014John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In age he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of Sussex. Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending their smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably rich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song. He appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained in the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America. The good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every meet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building to save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had within five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone. His wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance; though, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between. This mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and very much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic duties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her husband; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life. It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew", "chapter": "III\nThe Tragedy of Birlstone"}
{"text": "duties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her husband; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life. It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the wife was either very reticent about her husband\u2019s past life, or else, as seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where all gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people\u2019s memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance. There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was, it is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales Lodge, Hampstead. Cecil Barker\u2019s tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his new English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman; but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in America and had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to be a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor. In age he was rather younger than Douglas\u2014forty-five at the most\u2014a tall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes which might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a way for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess, over the beautiful countryside. \u201cAn easy-going, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Ames, the butler. \u201cBut, my word! I had rather not be the man that crossed him!\u201d He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly with his wife\u2014a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance.

Such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred. As to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and Mrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some of her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of January 6th. It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the breathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o\u2019clock, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot. On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge down, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling together in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there arrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village. The three men entered the fatal room together, while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants. The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.

The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. \u201cWe will touch nothing until my superiors arrive,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful head. \u201cNothing has been touched up to now,\u201d said Cecil Barker. \u201cI\u2019ll answer for that. You see it all exactly as I found it.\u201d \u201cWhen was that?\u201d The sergeant had drawn out his notebook. \u201cIt was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not very loud\u2014it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down\u2014I don\u2019t suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room.\u201d \u201cWas the door open?\u201d \u201cYes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom candle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes afterward.\u201d \u201cDid you see no one?\u201d \u201cNo. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back into the room once more.\u201d \u201cBut surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.\u201d \u201cYes, it was up until I lowered it.\u201d \u201cThen how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question! Mr. Douglas must have shot himself.\u201d \u201cThat was our first idea. But see!\u201d Barker drew aside the curtain, and showed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent. \u201cAnd look at this!\u201d He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. \u201cSomeone has stood there in getting out.\u201d \u201cYou mean that someone waded across the moat?\u201d \u201cExactly!\u201d \u201cThen if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he must have been in the water at that very moment.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the window! But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never occurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not let her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.\u201d \u201cHorrible enough!\u201d said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such injuries since the Birlstone railway smash.\u201d \u201cBut, I say,\u201d remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is, how did he ever get into", "chapter": "III\nThe Tragedy of Birlstone"}

That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.\u201d \u201cMrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,\u201d said Ames. \u201cI couldn\u2019t raise it until they went. Then I wound it up myself.\u201d \u201cThen it comes to this,\u201d said the sergeant: \u201cIf anyone came from outside\u2014_if_ they did\u2014they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room after eleven.\u201d \u201cThat is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him. That\u2019s how I read it; for nothing else will fit the facts.\u201d The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor. The initials V.V. and under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled in ink upon it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, holding it up.

I can make no sense of that.\u201d The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s V.V.? Somebody\u2019s initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?\u201d It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplace\u2014a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece. \u201cMr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw him myself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it. That accounts for the hammer.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d best put it back on the rug where we found it,\u201d said the sergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. \u201cIt will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It will be a London job before it is finished.\u201d He raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room. \u201cHullo!\u201d he cried, excitedly, drawing the window curtain to one side. \u201cWhat o\u2019clock were those curtains drawn?\u201d \u201cWhen the lamps were lit,\u201d said the butler. \u201cIt would be shortly after four.\u201d \u201cSomeone had been hiding here, sure enough.\u201d He held down the light, and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. \u201cI\u2019m bound to say this bears", "chapter": "III\nThe Tragedy of Birlstone"}

It looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and before six when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room, because it was the first that he saw. There was no other place where he could hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but Mr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how I read it,\u201d said Barker. \u201cBut, I say, aren\u2019t we wasting precious time? Couldn\u2019t we start out and scout the country before the fellow gets away?\u201d The sergeant considered for a moment. \u201cThere are no trains before six in the morning; so he can\u2019t get away by rail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it\u2019s odds that someone will notice him. Anyhow, I can\u2019t leave here myself until I am relieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand.\u201d The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body. \u201cWhat\u2019s this mark?\u201d he asked. \u201cCould this have any connection with the crime?\u201d The dead man\u2019s right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and exposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin. \u201cIt\u2019s not tattooed,\u201d said the doctor, peering through his glasses. \u201cI never saw anything like it. The man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t profess to know the meaning of it,\u201d said Cecil Barker; \u201cbut I have seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.\u201d \u201cAnd so have I,\u201d said the butler. \u201cMany a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I\u2019ve often wondered what it could be.\u201d \u201cThen it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,\u201d said the sergeant. \u201cBut it\u2019s a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum. Well, what is it now?\u201d The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead man\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken his wedding ring!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhat!\u201d \u201cYes, indeed.

{"text": "Chapter IV Darkness At three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the urgent call from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard, and he was at the Birlstone station at twelve o\u2019clock to welcome us. White Mason was a quiet, comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit, with a clean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired gamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer. \u201cA real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!\u201d he kept repeating. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I\u2019m hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that I can remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr. Holmes, or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville Arms. There\u2019s no other place; but I hear that it is clean and good. The man will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you please.\u201d He was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In ten minutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter. MacDonald made an occasional note; while Holmes sat absorbed, with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom. \u201cRemarkable!\u201d he said, when the story was unfolded, \u201cmost remarkable! I can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.\u201d \u201cI thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said White Mason in great delight. \u201cWe\u2019re well up with the times in Sussex. I\u2019ve told you now how matters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson between three and four this morning. My word! I made the old mare go! But I need not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out; for there was nothing immediate that I could do. Sergeant Wilson had all the facts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own.\u201d \u201cWhat were they?\u201d asked Holmes eagerly. \u201cWell, I first had the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood there to help me. We found no signs of violence upon it. I was hoping that if Mr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was no stain.\u201d \u201cThat, of course, proves nothing at all,\u201d remarked Inspector MacDonald. \u201cThere has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.\u201d \u201cQuite so.

It doesn\u2019t prove it wasn\u2019t used. But there might have been stains, and that would have helped us. As a matter of fact there were none. Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot cartridges, and, as Sergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that, if you pulled on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged. Whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot long\u2014one could carry it easily under one\u2019s coat. There was no complete maker\u2019s name; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.\u201d \u201cA big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cPennsylvania Small Arms Company\u2014well-known American firm,\u201d said Holmes. White Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him. \u201cThat is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful! Wonderful! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory?\u201d Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave. \u201cNo doubt it is an American shotgun,\u201d White Mason continued. \u201cI seem to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of America. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to me. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an American.\u201d MacDonald shook his head. \u201cMan, you are surely travelling overfast,\u201d said he. \u201cI have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all.\u201d \u201cThe open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, the marks of boots in the corner, the gun!\u201d \u201cNothing there that could not have been arranged. Mr. Douglas was an American, or had lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You don\u2019t need to import an American from outside in order to account for American doings.\u201d \u201cAmes, the butler\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat about him?

Oh, man, it\u2019s just inconceivable! It\u2019s clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr. Holmes, judging it by what we have heard.\u201d \u201cWell, state your case, Mr. Mac,\u201d said Holmes in his most judicial style. \u201cThe man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows anything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the house is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose? You would say the most silent in the world. Then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away at his leisure. That\u2019s understandable. But is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat? Is that credible, Mr. Holmes?\u201d \u201cWell, you put the case strongly,\u201d my friend replied thoughtfully. \u201cIt certainly needs a good deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White Mason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?\u201d \u201cThere were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a stone ledge, and one could hardly expect them.\u201d \u201cNo tracks or marks?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d \u201cHa! Would there be any objection, Mr. White Mason, to our going down to the house at once? There may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive.\u201d \u201cI was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go. I suppose if anything should strike you\u2014\u201d White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur. \u201cI have worked with Mr. Holmes before,\u201d said Inspector MacDonald. \u201cHe plays the game.\u201d \u201cMy own idea of the game, at any rate,\u201d said Holmes, with a smile. \u201cI", "chapter": "IV\nDarkness"}

If I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because they have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to score at their expense.

Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars, weather-stained and lichen-blotched, bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of Birlstone. A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural England, then a sudden turn, and the long, low Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay before us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it. As we approached it, there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold, winter sunshine. Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of births and of homecomings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked roofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue. As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy. \u201cThat\u2019s the window,\u201d said White Mason, \u201cthat one on the immediate right of the drawbridge. It\u2019s open just as it was found last night.\u201d \u201cIt looks rather narrow for a man to pass.\u201d \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a fat man, anyhow. We don\u2019t need your deductions, Mr. Holmes, to tell us that. But you or I could squeeze through all right.\u201d Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. Then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good look, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said White Mason. \u201cThere is nothing there, no sign that anyone has landed\u2014but why should he leave any sign?\u201d \u201cExactly.

The poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock. The village sergeant, a tall, formal, melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of Fate. The doctor had departed. \u201cAnything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?\u201d asked White Mason. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cThen you can go home. You\u2019ve had enough. We can send for you if we want you. The butler had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr. Cecil Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently. Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give you the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive at your own.\u201d He impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact and a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way in his profession. Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced. \u201cIs it suicide, or is it murder\u2014that\u2019s our first question, gentlemen, is it not? If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he then came down here in his dressing gown, trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him, opened the window, put blood on the\u2014\u201d \u201cWe can surely dismiss that,\u201d said MacDonald. \u201cSo I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been done. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house.\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s hear the argument.\u201d \u201cThere are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the other it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened\u2014a weapon that was never seen in the house before.

Do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark the sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man\u2019s finger, and all the rest of it? It\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cYou put it very clearly,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI am inclined to agree with you.\u201d \u201cWell, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside. We are still faced with some big difficulties; but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The man got into the house between four-thirty and six; that is to say, between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised. There had been some visitors, and the door was open; so there was nothing to prevent him. He may have been a common burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr. Douglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America, and this shotgun seems to be an American weapon, it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory. He slipped into this room because it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain. There he remained until past eleven at night. At that time Mr. Douglas entered the room. It was a short interview, if there were any interview at all; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot.\u201d \u201cThe candle shows that,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cExactly. The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half an inch. He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked; otherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. This shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. When Mr. Barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all clear enough.\u201d \u201cWell, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. Mr. Douglas enters the room. He puts down the candle. A man appears from behind the curtain. He is armed with this gun. He demands the wedding ring\u2014Heaven only knows why, but so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up.

How\u2019s that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d \u201cVery interesting, but just a little unconvincing.\u201d \u201cMan, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn\u2019t that anything else is even worse!\u201d cried MacDonald. \u201cSomebody killed the man, and whoever it was I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way. What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that? What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape? Come, Mr. Holmes, it\u2019s up to you to give us a lead, since you say Mr. White Mason\u2019s theory is unconvincing.\u201d Holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing no word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left, and his forehead wrinkled with speculation. \u201cI should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr. Mac,\u201d said he, kneeling down beside the body. \u201cDear me! these injuries are really appalling. Can we have the butler in for a moment?... Ames, I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark\u2014a branded triangle inside a circle\u2014upon Mr. Douglas\u2019s forearm?\u201d \u201cFrequently, sir.\u201d \u201cYou never heard any speculation as to what it meant?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cIt must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. It is undoubtedly a burn. Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of Mr. Douglas\u2019s jaw. Did you observe that in life?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.\u201d \u201cDid you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?\u201d \u201cNot for a very long time, sir.\u201d \u201cSuggestive!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt may, of course, be a mere coincidence, or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger. Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct, yesterday, Ames?\u201d \u201cIt struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.\u201d \u201cHa! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to make a little progress, do we not?

It was done by a thick pen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can you make anything of the inscription, Ames?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, nothing.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Mac?\u201d \u201cIt gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the same with his badge upon the forearm.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my idea, too,\u201d said White Mason. \u201cWell, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into the house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this weapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the dead man, which will, when mentioned in the papers, tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done. That all hangs together. But why this gun, of all weapons?\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cAnd why the missing ring?\u201d \u201cQuite so.\u201d \u201cAnd why no arrest? It\u2019s past two now. I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?\u201d \u201cThat is so, Mr. Holmes.\u201d \u201cWell, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready, they can hardly miss him. And yet they _have_ missed him up to now!\u201d Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill. \u201cIt is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably broad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a more shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What\u2019s this under the side table?\u201d \u201cMr. Douglas\u2019s dumb-bells,\u201d said Ames. \u201cDumb-bell\u2014there\u2019s only one. Where\u2019s the other?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not noticed them for months.\u201d \u201cOne dumb-bell\u2014\u201d Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door. A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us. I had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I had heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face. \u201cSorry to interrupt your consultation,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you should hear the latest news.\u201d \u201cAn arrest?\u201d \u201cNo such luck.

We could use the dining room, Ames. Please come yourself first and tell us what you know.\u201d The butler\u2019s account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity. He had been engaged five years before, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had been a kind and considerate employer\u2014not quite what Ames was used to, perhaps; but one can\u2019t have everything. He never saw any signs of apprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most fearless man he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked to keep the old ways up. Mr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the village; but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas that day; for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual with him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in the pantry at the back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell ring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he would, as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between. The housekeeper had come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell. They had gone to the front of the house together. As they reached the bottom of the stairs he had seen Mrs. Douglas coming down it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged her to go back. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, go back to your room!\u201d he cried. \u201cPoor Jack is dead! You can do nothing. For God\u2019s sake, go back!\u201d After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back. She did not scream. She made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom. Ames and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study, where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it. The candle was not lit at that time; but the lamp was burning.

They had looked out of the window; but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard. They had then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried off to get the police. Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler. The account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a corroboration of that of her fellow servant. The housekeeper\u2019s room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames had been working. She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention. She was a little hard of hearing. Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot; but in any case the study was a long way off. She remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door. That was a good deal earlier\u2014half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr. Ames ran to the front she went with him. She saw Mr. Barker, very pale and excited, come out of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who was coming down the stairs. He entreated her to go back, and she answered him, but what she said could not be heard. \u201cTake her up! Stay with her!\u201d he had said to Mrs. Allen. She had therefore taken her to the bedroom, and endeavoured to soothe her. She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other attempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire, with her head sunk in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with her most of the night. As to the other servants, they had all gone to bed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived. They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not possibly have heard anything. So far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement. Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences of the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already told the police. Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window. The bloodstain was conclusive, in his opinion, on that point. Besides, as the bridge was up, there was no other possible way of escaping. He could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He could not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place more than three feet deep. In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder.

He could not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place more than three feet deep. In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. Douglas was a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke. He had emigrated to America when he was a very young man. He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in California, where they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called Benito Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas had suddenly sold out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in London. Thus they had renewed their friendship. Douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from California, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in England, as being connected with this peril. He imagined that some secret society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas\u2019s track, which would never rest until it killed him. Some remarks of his had given him this idea; though he had never told him what the society was, nor how he had come to offend it. He could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society. \u201cHow long were you with Douglas in California?\u201d asked Inspector MacDonald. \u201cFive years altogether.\u201d \u201cHe was a bachelor, you say?\u201d \u201cA widower.\u201d \u201cHave you ever heard where his first wife came from?\u201d \u201cNo, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I have seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of typhoid the year before I met him.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t associate his past with any particular part of America?\u201d \u201cI have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew that city well and had worked there. I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. He had travelled a good deal in his time.\u201d \u201cWas he a politician? Had this secret society to do with politics?\u201d \u201cNo, he cared nothing about politics.\u201d \u201cYou have no reason to think it was criminal?\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.\u201d \u201cWas there anything curious about his life in California?\u201d \u201cHe liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. He would never go where other men were if he could help it. That\u2019s why I first thought that someone was after him. Then when he left so suddenly for Europe I made sure that it was so.

They came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was. I told them that he was gone to Europe and that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good\u2014it was easy to see that.\u201d \u201cWere these men Americans\u2014Californians?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about Californians. They were Americans, all right. But they were not miners. I don\u2019t know what they were, and was very glad to see their backs.\u201d \u201cThat was six years ago?\u201d \u201cNearer seven.\u201d \u201cAnd then you were together five years in California, so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least?\u201d \u201cThat is so.\u201d \u201cIt must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would give rise to it.\u201d \u201cI think it shadowed his whole life. It was never quite out of his mind.\u201d \u201cBut if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don\u2019t you think he would turn to the police for protection?\u201d \u201cMaybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against. There\u2019s one thing you should know. He always went about armed. His revolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe.\u201d \u201cI should like these dates a little clearer,\u201d said MacDonald. \u201cIt is quite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next year, did you not?\u201d \u201cThat is so.\u201d \u201cAnd he had been married five years. You must have returned about the time of his marriage.\u201d \u201cAbout a month before. I was his best man.\u201d \u201cDid you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?\u201d \u201cNo, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.\u201d \u201cBut you have seen a good deal of her since.\u201d Barker looked sternly at the detective. \u201cI have seen a good deal of _him_ since,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf I have seen her, it is because you cannot visit a man without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is any connection\u2014\u201d \u201cI imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case.

Then he looked up with a smile. \u201cWell, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all, and I have no right to stand in the way of it. I\u2019d only ask you not to worry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has enough upon her just now. I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world, and that was his jealousy. He was fond of me\u2014no man could be fonder of a friend. And he was devoted to his wife. He loved me to come here, and was forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him, and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment. More than once I\u2019ve sworn off coming for that reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring letters that I just had to. But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if it was my last word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful wife\u2014and I can say also no friend could be more loyal than I!\u201d It was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald could not dismiss the subject. \u201cYou are aware,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the dead man\u2019s wedding ring has been taken from his finger?\u201d \u201cSo it appears,\u201d said Barker. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018appears\u2019? You know it as a fact.\u201d The man seemed confused and undecided. \u201cWhen I said \u2018appears\u2019 I meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.\u201d \u201cThe mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed it, would suggest to anyone\u2019s mind, would it not, that the marriage and the tragedy were connected?\u201d Barker shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t profess to say what it means,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady\u2019s honour\u201d\u2014his eyes blazed for an instant, and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions\u2014\u201cwell, you are on the wrong track, that\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cI", "chapter": "V\nThe People of the Drama"}

That seems very remarkable.\u201d Again Barker showed some signs of indecision. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it was remarkable, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he answered after a pause. \u201cThe candle threw a very bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was on the table; so I lit it.\u201d \u201cAnd blew out the candle?\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something of defiance in it, turned and left the room. Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman of thirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very different from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is true that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured a great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own. Her sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech. \u201cHave you found anything out yet?\u201d she asked. Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question? \u201cWe have taken every possible step, Mrs. Douglas,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cYou may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.\u201d \u201cSpare no money,\u201d she said in a dead, even tone. \u201cIt is my desire that every possible effort should be made.\u201d \u201cPerhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter.\u201d \u201cI fear not; but all I know is at your service.\u201d \u201cWe have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually see\u2014that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?\u201d \u201cNo, he turned me back upon the stairs.

It is so hard to reckon time at such a moment. He implored me not to go on. He assured me that I could do nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. It was all like some dreadful dream.\u201d \u201cCan you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot?\u201d \u201cNo, I cannot say. He went from his dressing room, and I did not hear him go. He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous of fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.\u201d \u201cThat is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have known your husband only in England, have you not?\u201d \u201cYes, we have been married five years.\u201d \u201cHave you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and might bring some danger upon him?\u201d Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at last, \u201cI have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He refused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in me\u2014there was the most complete love and confidence between us\u2014but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.\u201d \u201cHow did you know it, then?\u201d Mrs. Douglas\u2019s face lit with a quick smile. \u201cCan a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it? I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his American life. I knew it by certain precautions he took. I knew it by certain words he let fall. I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies, that he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on his guard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected.\u201d \u201cMight I ask,\u201d asked Holmes, \u201cwhat the words were which attracted your attention?\u201d \u201cThe Valley of Fear,\u201d the lady answered. \u201cThat was an expression he has used when I questioned him. \u2018I have been in the Valley of Fear.", "chapter": "V\nThe People of the Drama"}

Then I remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror. McGinty was the name\u2014Bodymaster McGinty. I asked him when he recovered who Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. \u2018Never of mine, thank God!\u2019 he answered with a laugh, and that was all I could get from him. But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and the Valley of Fear.\u201d \u201cThere is one other point,\u201d said Inspector MacDonald. \u201cYou met Mr. Douglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged to him there? Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?\u201d \u201cThere was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing mysterious.\u201d \u201cHe had no rival?\u201d \u201cNo, I was quite free.\u201d \u201cYou have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does that suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?\u201d For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman\u2019s lips. [Illustration: For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman\u2019s lips.] \u201cI really cannot tell,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt is certainly a most extraordinary thing.\u201d \u201cWell, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cThere are some other points, no doubt; but we can refer to you as they arise.\u201d She rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us. \u201cWhat impression has my evidence made upon you?\u201d The question", "chapter": "V\nThe People of the Drama"}

Then, with a bow, she swept from the room. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman\u2014a very beautiful woman,\u201d said MacDonald thoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. \u201cThis man Barker has certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be attractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then there\u2019s that wedding ring. You can\u2019t get past that. The man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man\u2019s\u2014What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?\u201d My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest thought. Now he rose and rang the bell. \u201cAmes,\u201d he said, when the butler entered, \u201cwhere is Mr. Cecil Barker now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see, sir.\u201d He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden. \u201cCan you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study?\u201d \u201cYes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his boots when he went for the police.\u201d \u201cWhere are the slippers now?\u201d \u201cThey are still under the chair in the hall.\u201d \u201cVery good, Ames. It is, of course, important for us to know which tracks may be Mr. Barker\u2019s and which from outside.\u201d \u201cYes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with blood\u2014so indeed were my own.\u201d \u201cThat is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very good, Ames. We will ring if we want you.\u201d A few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of both were dark with blood. \u201cStrange!\u201d murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely. \u201cVery strange indeed!\u201d Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in silence at his colleagues. The inspector was transfigured with excitement. His native accent rattled like a stick upon railings. \u201cMan,\u201d he cried, \u201cthere\u2019s not a doubt of it! Barker has just marked the window himself. It\u2019s a good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that you said it was a splay-foot, and here\u2019s the explanation. But what\u2019s the game, Mr. Holmes\u2014what\u2019s the game?\u201d \u201cAy, what\u2019s the game?\u201d my friend repeated thoughtfully.

{"text": "Chapter VI A Dawning Light The three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire; so I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn. But before doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which flanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves. In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget, or remember only as some fantastic nightmare, that darkened study with the sprawling, bloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred, which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in my mind. I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. At the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. On the other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. As I approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter. An instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit upon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my presence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the dining-room she had been demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away from her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat forward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an answering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant\u2014but it was just one instant too late\u2014they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view. A hurried word or two passed between them, and then Barker rose and came towards me. \u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cbut am I addressing Dr. Watson?\u201d I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind. \u201cWe thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?\u201d I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind\u2019s eye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve. I had grieved with her grief in the dining room. Now I met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye. \u201cI fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted,\u201d said she.

I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cIt is no business of mine,\u201d said I. \u201cPerhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized\u2014\u201d \u201cThere is no need why Dr. Watson should realize,\u201d said Barker quickly. \u201cAs he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d said I, \u201cand so I will beg leave to resume my walk.\u201d \u201cOne moment, Dr. Watson,\u201d cried the woman in a pleading voice. \u201cThere is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You know Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Barker eagerly. \u201cIs he on his own or is he entirely in with them?\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t know that I should be justified in discussing such a point.\u201d \u201cI beg\u2014I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I assure you that you will be helping us\u2014helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.\u201d There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman\u2019s voice that for the instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will. \u201cMr. Holmes is an independent investigator,\u201d I said. \u201cHe is his own master, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time, he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this I can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted fuller information.\u201d So saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate. \u201cI wish none of their confidences,\u201d said Holmes, when I reported to him what had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. \u201cNo confidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder.\u201d \u201cYou think it will come to that?\u201d He was in his most cheerful and debonair humour. \u201cMy", "chapter": "VI\nA Dawning Light"}

I don\u2019t say that we have fathomed it\u2014far from it\u2014but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell\u2014\u201d \u201cThe dumb-bell!\u201d \u201cDear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell? Well, well, you need not be downcast; for between ourselves I don\u2019t think that either Inspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson! Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to yourself the unilateral development, the imminent danger of a spinal curvature. Shocking, Watson, shocking!\u201d He sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. The mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success; for I had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin, eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement. \u201cA lie, Watson\u2014a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising lie\u2014that\u2019s what meets us on the threshold! There is our starting point. The whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker\u2019s story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are both lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why are they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to conceal? Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth. \u201cHow do I know that they are lying? Because it is a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true. Consider! According to the story given to us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the dead man\u2019s finger, to replace the other ring\u2014a thing which he would surely never have done\u2014and to put that singular card beside his victim. I say that this was obviously impossible. \u201cYou may argue\u2014but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson, to think that you will do so\u2014that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed.

I say that this was obviously impossible. \u201cYou may argue\u2014but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson, to think that you will do so\u2014that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from what we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of his giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit. Of that I have no doubt at all. \u201cBut the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. Therefore the shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told. But there could be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are in the presence, therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who heard the gunshot\u2014of the man Barker and of the woman Douglas. When on the top of this I am able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill was deliberately placed there by Barker, in order to give a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows dark against him. \u201cNow we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did occur. Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so it was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in the pantry. I have been trying some experiments after you left us this afternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut. \u201cIt is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper\u2019s room. It is not so far down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this instance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen\u2019s room. She is, as she has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the murder. \u201cIf this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas, presuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing from quarter to eleven, when", "chapter": "VI\nA Dawning Light"}

What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm? That is the question which faces us, and when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem.\u201d \u201cI am convinced myself,\u201d said I, \u201cthat there is an understanding between those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband\u2019s murder.\u201d \u201cExactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any man\u2019s spoken word stand between them and that husband\u2019s dead body. Should I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her. It was badly stage-managed; for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation. If there had been nothing else, this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind.\u201d \u201cYou think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty of the murder?\u201d \u201cThere is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. \u201cThey come at me like bullets. If you put it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder, and are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled answer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so clear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way. \u201cWe will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love, and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them. It is a large supposition; for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. On the contrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very attached to each other.\u201d \u201cThat, I am sure, cannot be true,\u201d said I, thinking of the beautiful smiling face in the garden. \u201cWell, at least they gave that impression.

However, we will suppose that they are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a man over whose head some danger hangs\u2014\u201d \u201cWe have only their word for that.\u201d Holmes looked thoughtful. \u201cI see, Watson. You are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false. According to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider. The stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have been prepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won\u2019t slip into their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons\u2014and an American one at that? How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them? It\u2019s a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?\u201d \u201cI confess that I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d \u201cThen again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death? Does that strike you as very probable, Watson?\u201d \u201cNo, it does not.\u201d \u201cAnd once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape.\u201d \u201cI can conceive of no explanation.\u201d \u201cAnd yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation. Simply as a mental exercise, without any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line of thought. It is, I admit, mere imagination; but how often is imagination the mother of truth? \u201cWe will suppose that there was a guilty secret, a really shameful secret in the life of this man Douglas. This leads to his murder by someone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside. This avenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss to explain, took the dead man\u2019s wedding ring. The vendetta might conceivably date back to the man\u2019s first marriage, and the ring be taken for some such reason. \u201cBefore", "chapter": "VI\nA Dawning Light"}

The vendetta might conceivably date back to the man\u2019s first marriage, and the ring be taken for some such reason. \u201cBefore this avenger got away, Barker and the wife had reached the room. The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to this idea, and preferred to let him go. For this purpose they probably lowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then raised it again. He made his escape, and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away. So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?\u201d \u201cWell, it is possible, no doubt,\u201d said I, with some reserve. \u201cWe have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred is certainly something very extraordinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious case, the couple\u2014not necessarily a guilty couple\u2014realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it. They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation. The mark was put by Barker\u2019s bloodstained slipper upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive got away. They obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun; so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half hour after the event.\u201d \u201cAnd how do you propose to prove all this?\u201d \u201cWell, if there were an outsider, he may be traced and taken. That would be the most effective of all proofs. But if not\u2014well, the resources of science are far from being exhausted. I think that an evening alone in that study would help me much.\u201d \u201cAn evening alone!\u201d \u201cI propose to go up there presently.

It was at Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It was clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified at once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered his name as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise was London made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was undoubtedly an American.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Holmes gleefully, \u201cyou have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It\u2019s a lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac.\u201d \u201cAy, it\u2019s just that, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said the inspector with satisfaction. \u201cBut this may all fit in with your theories,\u201d I remarked. \u201cThat may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there nothing to identify this man?\u201d \u201cSo little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification. There were no papers or letters, and no marking upon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table. He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our inquiries.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said White Mason. \u201cIf the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist. As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.\u201d \u201cSo one would imagine.

As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.\u201d \u201cSo one would imagine. Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to date, at any rate, since he has not been taken. But his description\u2014what of that?\u201d MacDonald referred to his notebook. \u201cHere we have it so far as they could give it. They don\u2019t seem to have taken any very particular stock of him; but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points. He was a man about five foot nine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a grayish moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding.\u201d \u201cWell, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of Douglas himself,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe is just over fifty, with grizzled hair and moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything else?\u201d \u201cHe was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.\u201d \u201cWhat about the shotgun?\u201d \u201cIt is less than two feet long. It could very well have fitted into his valise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty.\u201d \u201cAnd how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?\u201d \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said MacDonald, \u201cwhen we have got our man\u2014and you may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it\u2014we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it stands, we have surely gone a long way. We know that an American calling himself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with bicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle, with his gun concealed in his overcoat. No one saw him arrive, so far as we can learn; but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates, and there are many cyclists upon the road. Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with his eye on the house, waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out. The shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house; but he had intended to use it outside, and there it has very obvious advantages, as it would be impossible to miss with it, and the sound of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken.\u201d \u201cThat is all very clear,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWell, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next? He left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge down and no one about. He took his", "chapter": "VI\nA Dawning Light"}

What was he to do next? He left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge down and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make some excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first room that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. Thence he could see the drawbridge go up, and he knew that his only escape was through the moat. He waited until quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room. He shot him and escaped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him; so he left it there and made his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged. How is that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d \u201cWell, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. That is your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer\u2019s escape\u2014or at least that they reached the room before he escaped\u2014and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge. That\u2019s my reading of the first half.\u201d The two detectives shook their heads. \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tumble out of one mystery into another,\u201d said the London inspector. \u201cAnd in some ways a worse one,\u201d added White Mason. \u201cThe lady has never been in America in all her life. What possible connection could she have with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him?\u201d \u201cI freely admit the difficulties,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI propose to make a little investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause.\u201d \u201cCan we help you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d \u201cNo, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson\u2019s umbrella\u2014my wants are simple. And Ames, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question\u2014why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell?\u201d It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion. We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that the little country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was partly awakened by his entrance. \u201cWell, Holmes,\u201d I murmured, \u201chave you found anything out?\u201d He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand.

{"text": "Chapter VII The Solution Next morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and White Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing. Three had been placed on one side. \u201cStill on the track of the elusive bicyclist?\u201d Holmes asked cheerfully. \u201cWhat is the latest news of the ruffian?\u201d MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence. \u201cHe is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton, Derby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of them\u2014East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool\u2014there is a clear case against him, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats.\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d said Holmes sympathetically. \u201cNow, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. White Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I went into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt remember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories, but that I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they were correct. For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said that I would play the game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task. Therefore I am here to advise you this morning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words\u2014abandon the case.\u201d MacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague. \u201cYou consider it hopeless!\u201d cried the inspector. \u201cI consider your case to be hopeless. I do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth.\u201d \u201cBut this cyclist. He is not an invention. We have his description, his valise, his bicycle. The fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not get him?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him; but I would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.\u201d \u201cYou are holding something back. It\u2019s hardly fair of you, Mr. Holmes.\u201d The inspector was annoyed. \u201cYou know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study.\u201d \u201cThis is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes.

What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?\u201d \u201cWell, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House.\u201d \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d \u201cAh, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment. By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.\u201d Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket. \u201cIt immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac, when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one\u2019s surroundings. Don\u2019t look so impatient; for I assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one\u2019s mind. Permit me to give you a sample. \u2018Erected in the fifth year of the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older building, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence\u2014\u2019\u201d \u201cYou are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!\u201d \u201cTut, tut, Mr. Mac!\u2014the first sign of temper I have detected in you. Well, I won\u2019t read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the subject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours.\u201d \u201cIs it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You will excuse these remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit that,\u201d said the detective heartily. \u201cYou get to your point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing it.\u201d \u201cWell, well, I\u2019ll drop past history and get down to present-day facts.

I saw no necessity to disturb them; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was specially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities, which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.\u201d \u201cWhat! With that?\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cNo, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr. Mac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed an instructive quarter of an hour.\u201d \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d \u201cWell, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for the missing dumb-bell. It has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case. I ended by finding it.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAh, there we come to the edge of the unexplored. Let me go a little further, a very little further, and I will promise that you shall share everything that I know.\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019re bound to take you on your own terms,\u201d said the inspector; \u201cbut when it comes to telling us to abandon the case\u2014why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case?\u201d \u201cFor the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating.\u201d \u201cWe are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, so you are. But don\u2019t trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle. I assure you that it won\u2019t help you.\u201d \u201cThen what do you suggest that we do?\u201d \u201cI will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m bound to say I\u2019ve always found you had reason behind all your queer ways. I\u2019ll do what you advise.\u201d \u201cAnd you, Mr. White Mason?\u201d The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes and his methods were new to him. \u201cWell, if it is good enough for the inspector, it is good enough for me,\u201d he said at last. \u201cCapital!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWell, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery country walk for both of you. They tell me that the views from Birlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable.

At that hour we shall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we like; for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.\u201d Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious in his manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d said my friend gravely, \u201cI am asking you now to put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I have come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our expedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats. It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.\u201d We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through this we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised. Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed his example. \u201cWell, what are we to do now?\u201d asked MacDonald with some gruffness. \u201cPossess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cWhat are we here for at all?

Surely our profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder\u2014what can one make of such a denouement? But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories\u2014are these not the pride and the justification of our life\u2019s work? At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt. Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable? I only ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.\u201d \u201cWell, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold,\u201d said the London detective with comic resignation. We all had good reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything else was dark and still. \u201cHow long is this to last?\u201d asked the inspector finally. \u201cAnd what is it we are watching for?\u201d \u201cI have no more notion than you how long it is to last,\u201d Holmes answered with some asperity. \u201cIf criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains, it would certainly be more convenient for all of us. As to what it is we\u2014 Well, _that\u2019s_ what we are watching for!\u201d As he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man\u2019s head and shoulders looking out into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive, stealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish\u2014some large, round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement. \u201cNow!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cNow!\u201d We were all upon our feet,", "chapter": "VII\nThe Solution"}

There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the amazed Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a word and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching. The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us as we entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes. \u201cWhat the devil is the meaning of all this?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat are you after, anyhow?\u201d Holmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing table. \u201cThis is what we are after, Mr. Barker\u2014this bundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.\u201d Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. \u201cHow in thunder came you to know anything about it?\u201d he asked. \u201cSimply that I put it there.\u201d \u201cYou put it there! You!\u201d \u201cPerhaps I should have said \u2018replaced it there,\u2019\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou will remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at least worth testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the crook of Dr. Watson\u2019s umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle. \u201cIt was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to prove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had, of course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. We have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies now with you.\u201d Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it.

From within he extracted a dumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he drew forth a pair of boots. \u201cAmerican, as you perceive,\u201d he remarked, pointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising a complete set of underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yellow overcoat. \u201cThe clothes are commonplace,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201csave only the overcoat, which is full of suggestive touches.\u201d He held it tenderly towards the light. \u201cHere, as you perceive, is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece.

I have some recollection, Mr. Barker, that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Douglas\u2019s first wife, and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V.V. upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is fairly clear. And now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation.\u201d It was a sight to see Cecil Barker\u2019s expressive face during this exposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony. \u201cYou know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some more,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker; but it would come with a better grace from you.\u201d \u201cOh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say is that if there\u2019s any secret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.\u201d \u201cWell, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,\u201d said the inspector quietly, \u201cwe must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you.\u201d \u201cYou can do what you damn please about that,\u201d said Barker defiantly.

Mrs. Douglas had been standing listening at the half opened door, and now she entered the room. \u201cYou have done enough for now, Cecil,\u201d said she. \u201cWhatever comes of it in the future, you have done enough.\u201d \u201cEnough and more than enough,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. \u201cI have every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be that I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime. Now I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there is much that is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr. Douglas to tell us his own story.\u201d Mrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes\u2019s words. The detectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in an instant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his outstretched hand. \u201cIt\u2019s best this way, Jack,\u201d his wife repeated; \u201cI am sure that it is best.\u201d \u201cIndeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cI am sure that you will find it best.\u201d The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin, and a humorous mouth. He took a good look at us all, and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you,\u201d said he in a voice which was not quite English and not quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. \u201cYou are the historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you\u2019ve never had such a story as that pass through your hands before, and I\u2019ll lay my last dollar on that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and you can\u2019t miss the public so long as you have those. I\u2019ve been cooped up two days, and I\u2019ve spent the daylight hours\u2014as much daylight as I could get in that rat trap\u2014in putting the thing into words. You\u2019re welcome to them\u2014you and your public.

There\u2019s the story of the Valley of Fear.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the past, Mr. Douglas,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes quietly. \u201cWhat we desire now is to hear your story of the present.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have it, sir,\u201d said Douglas. \u201cMay I smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes. You\u2019re a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and you\u2019ll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.\u201d He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet you. But before you are through with that,\u201d he nodded at my papers, \u201cyou will say I\u2019ve brought you something fresh.\u201d Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement. \u201cWell, this fairly beats me!\u201d he cried at last. \u201cIf you are Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been investigating for these two days, and where in the world have you sprung from now? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jack-in-a-box.\u201d \u201cAh, Mr. Mac,\u201d said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, \u201cyou would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used may be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas under this roof.\u201d \u201cAnd how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?\u201d said the inspector angrily. \u201cHow long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?\u201d \u201cNot one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray what more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible. Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be, and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape.\u201d \u201cWell, you figured it out about right,\u201d said Douglas approvingly. \u201cI thought I\u2019d dodge your British law; for I was not sure", "chapter": "VII\nThe Solution"}

Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you\u2019ll judge that for yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me, Inspector: I\u2019m ready to stand pat upon the truth. \u201cI\u2019m not going to begin at the beginning. That\u2019s all there,\u201d he indicated my bundle of papers, \u201cand a mighty queer yarn you\u2019ll find it. It all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in this world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they chased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable. \u201cI never explained to my wife how things were. Why should I pull her into it? She would never have a quiet moment again; but would always be imagining trouble. I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a word here or a word there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had seen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she knew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything now, and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it was a hard question, dear,\u201d he took her hand for an instant in his own, \u201cand I acted for the best. \u201cWell, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in Tunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was only a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all\u2014one who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I guessed I\u2019d fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb in the States about \u201976.

It\u2019s as well, or he\u2019d have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up\u2014my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings\u2014I put the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the house and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing gown, as was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented danger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life\u2014and I\u2019ve had more than most in my time\u2014there is a kind of sixth sense that waves the red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn\u2019t tell you why. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I saw why plain enough. \u201cI\u2019d just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good light from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle and jumped for a hammer that I\u2019d left on the mantel. At the same moment he sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the floor. He dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he\u2019d got his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had got hold of it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the man that lost his grip. \u201cHe never lost his grip; but he got it butt downward for a moment too long. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it off between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I was, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I\u2019d recognized him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother wouldn\u2019t recognize him as I saw him then. I\u2019m used to rough work; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him. \u201cI was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down.

Then we understood that they could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known only to ourselves. \u201cIt was at that instant that the idea came to me. I was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it. The man\u2019s sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See here!\u201d The man whom we had known as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had seen upon the dead man. \u201cIt was the sight of that which started me on it. I seemed to see it all clear at a glance. There were his height and hair and figure, about the same as my own. No one could swear to his face, poor devil! I brought down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker and I had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We tied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only weight I could find and put them through the window. The card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own. \u201cMy rings were put on his finger; but when it came to the wedding ring,\u201d he held out his muscular hand, \u201cyou can see for yourselves that I had struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was married, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don\u2019t know, anyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted to I couldn\u2019t. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it where I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it. \u201cWell, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then get away where I could be joined by my \u2018widow\u2019 we should have a chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives.

I hadn\u2019t much time to make it all clear to Barker and to my wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all about this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to connect it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the rest. \u201cI guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. He opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge was up there was no other way. Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the bell for all he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so, gentlemen, you can do what you please; but I\u2019ve told you the truth and the whole truth, so help me God! What I ask you now is how do I stand by the English law?\u201d There was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes. \u201cThe English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse than your deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?\u201d \u201cI know nothing of this.\u201d Holmes\u2019s face was very white and grave. \u201cThe story is not over yet, I fear,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may find worse dangers than the English law, or even than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr. Douglas. You\u2019ll take my advice and still be on your guard.\u201d And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me for a time, far from the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as John Douglas. I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and westward some thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a singular and terrible narrative\u2014so singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that even as I tell it, even so did it occur.

{"text": "Chapter I The Man It was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains. The steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening train which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of Merton. It was a single track railroad; but at every siding\u2014and they were numerous\u2014long lines of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of America. For desolate it was! Little could the first pioneer who had traversed it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest. Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their flanks, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow, and jagged rock towered upon each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous valley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly crawling. The oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car, a long, bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. The greater number of these were workmen returning from their day\u2019s toil in the lower part of the valley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves miners. These sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen. Several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company, with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It is with this man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him; for he is worth it. He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would guess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be friendly to all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready smile. And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might conceivably", "chapter": "I\nThe Man"}

And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was introduced. Having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and receiving only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to uncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading landscape. It was not a cheering prospect. Through the growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden houses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants. The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for the leisured or the cultured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong workers who did it. The young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of mingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to him. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he referred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. Once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a man. It was a navy revolver of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to the light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum showed that it was fully loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret pocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench. \u201cHullo, mate!\u201d said he. \u201cYou seem heeled and ready.\u201d The young man smiled with an air of embarrassment. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cwe need them sometimes in the place I come from.\u201d \u201cAnd where may that be?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m last from Chicago.\u201d \u201cA stranger in these parts?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou may find you need it here,\u201d said the workman. \u201cAh! is that so?\u201d The young man seemed interested. \u201cHave you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?\u201d \u201cNothing out of the way.\u201d \u201cWhy, I thought the country was full of it. You\u2019ll hear quick enough. What made you come here?\u201d \u201cI heard there was always work for a willing man.\u201d \u201cAre you a member of the union?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019ll get your job, I guess.

There\u2019s no town without a lodge, and where there is a lodge I\u2019ll find my friends.\u201d The remark had a singular effect upon his companion. He glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car. The miners were still whispering among themselves. The two police officers were dozing. He came across, seated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand. \u201cPut it there,\u201d he said. A hand-grip passed between the two. \u201cI see you speak the truth,\u201d said the workman. \u201cBut it\u2019s well to make certain.\u201d He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow. \u201cDark nights are unpleasant,\u201d said the workman. \u201cYes, for strangers to travel,\u201d the other answered. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough. I\u2019m Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. Glad to see you in these parts.\u201d \u201cThank you. I\u2019m Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster J.H. Scott. But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.\u201d \u201cWell, there are plenty of us about. You won\u2019t find the order more flourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley. But we could do with some lads like you. I can\u2019t understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in Chicago.\u201d \u201cI found plenty of work to do,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cThen why did you leave?\u201d McMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled. \u201cI guess those chaps would be glad to know,\u201d he said. Scanlan groaned sympathetically. \u201cIn trouble?\u201d he asked in a whisper. \u201cDeep.\u201d \u201cA penitentiary job?\u201d \u201cAnd the rest.\u201d \u201cNot a killing!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s early days to talk of such things,\u201d said McMurdo with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. \u201cI\u2019ve my own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for you. Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things?\u201d His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses. \u201cAll right, mate, no offense meant. The boys will think none the worse of you, whatever you may have done. Where are you bound for now?\u201d \u201cVermissa.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the third halt down the line. Where are you staying?\u201d McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp. \u201cHere is the address\u2014Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It\u2019s a boarding house that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat.

He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe we\u2019ll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you are in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.\u201d Scanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts. Night had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness. Against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining, twisting and turning, with the motion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar. \u201cI guess hell must look something like that,\u201d said a voice. McMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste. \u201cFor that matter,\u201d said the other policeman, \u201cI allow that hell must _be_ something like that. If there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name, it\u2019s more than I\u2019d expect. I guess you are new to this part, young man?\u201d \u201cWell, what if I am?\u201d McMurdo answered in a surly voice. \u201cJust this, mister, that I should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I were you.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell is it to you who are my friends?\u201d roared McMurdo in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation. \u201cDid I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such a sucker that I couldn\u2019t move without it? You speak when you are spoken to, and by the Lord you\u2019d have to wait a long time if it was me!\u201d He thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog. The two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected. \u201cNo offense, stranger,\u201d said one. \u201cIt was a warning for your own good, seeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m new to the place; but I\u2019m not new to you and your kind!\u201d cried McMurdo in cold fury. \u201cI guess you\u2019re the same in all places, shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it.\u201d \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll see more of you before very long,\u201d said one of the patrolmen with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.\u201d \u201cI was thinking the same,\u201d remarked the other. \u201cI", "chapter": "I\nThe Man"}

Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face\u2014don\u2019t make any mistake about that!\u201d There was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer, while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves. A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station, and there was a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line. McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off into the darkness, when one of the miners accosted him. \u201cBy Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the cops,\u201d he said in a voice of awe. \u201cIt was grand to hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you the road. I\u2019m passing Shafter\u2019s on the way to my own shack.\u201d There was a chorus of friendly \u201cGood-nights\u201d from the other miners as they passed from the platform. Before ever he had set foot in it, McMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa. The country had been a place of terror; but the town was in its way even more depressing. Down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty. As they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous wages. \u201cThat\u2019s the Union House,\u201d said the guide, pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel. \u201cJack McGinty is the boss there.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of a man is he?\u201d McMurdo asked. \u201cWhat! have you never heard of the boss?\u201d \u201cHow could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in these parts?\u201d \u201cWell, I", "chapter": "I\nThe Man"}

There\u2019s only one set of affairs that you\u2019ll hear of in these parts, and that\u2019s the affairs of the Scowrers.\u201d \u201cWhy, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago. A gang of murderers, are they not?\u201d \u201cHush, on your life!\u201d cried the miner, standing still in alarm, and gazing in amazement at his companion. \u201cMan, you won\u2019t live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that. Many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less.\u201d \u201cWell, I know nothing about them. It\u2019s only what I have read.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying that you have not read the truth.\u201d The man looked nervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he feared to see some lurking danger. \u201cIf killing is murder, then God knows there is murder and to spare. But don\u2019t you dare to breathe the name of Jack McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every whisper goes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. Now, that\u2019s the house you\u2019re after, that one standing back from the street. You\u2019ll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township.\u201d \u201cI thank you,\u201d said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the dwelling house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock. It was opened at once by someone very different from what he had expected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of the German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour over her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it seemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture; the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So entranced was he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she who broke the silence. \u201cI thought it was father,\u201d said she with a pleasing little touch of a German accent. \u201cDid you come to see him? He is down town.", "chapter": "I\nThe Man"}

I expect him back every minute.\u201d McMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor. \u201cNo, miss,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to see him. But your house was recommended to me for board. I thought it might suit me\u2014and now I know it will.\u201d \u201cYou are quick to make up your mind,\u201d said she with a smile. \u201cAnyone but a blind man could do as much,\u201d the other answered. She laughed at the compliment. \u201cCome right in, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter\u2019s daughter. My mother\u2019s dead, and I run the house. You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes along\u2014Ah, here he is! So you can fix things with him right away.\u201d A heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. In a few words McMurdo explained his business. A man of the name of Murphy had given him the address in Chicago. He in turn had had it from someone else. Old Shafter was quite ready. The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed at once to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money. For seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and lodging. So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took up his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant land.", "chapter": "I\nThe Man"}
{"text": "Chapter II The Bodymaster McMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk around soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most important person at Shafter\u2019s. There were ten or a dozen boarders there; but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores, of a very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest, his conversation the brightest, and his song the best. He was a born boon companion, with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around him. And yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway carriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger, which compelled the respect and even the fear of those who met him. For the law, too, and all who were connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders. From the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes upon her beauty and her grace. He was no backward suitor. On the second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onward he repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him. \u201cSomeone else?\u201d he would cry. \u201cWell, the worse luck for someone else! Let him look out for himself! Am I to lose my life\u2019s chance and all my heart\u2019s desire for someone else? You can keep on saying no, Ettie: the day will come when you will say yes, and I\u2019m young enough to wait.\u201d He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue, and his pretty, coaxing ways. There was about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attracts a woman\u2019s interest, and finally her love. He could talk of the sweet valleys of County Monaghan from which he came, of the lovely, distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow. Then he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of Detroit, and the lumber camps of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he had worked in a planing mill. And afterwards came the hint of romance, the feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city, so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. He spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a strange world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy\u2014those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.

McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a well-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the Eminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had met in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man, seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit. \u201cSay, McMurdo,\u201d said he, \u201cI remembered your address, so I made bold to call. I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019ve not reported to the Bodymaster. Why haven\u2019t you seen Boss McGinty yet?\u201d \u201cWell, I had to find a job. I have been busy.\u201d \u201cYou must find time for him if you have none for anything else. Good Lord, man! you\u2019re a fool not to have been down to the Union House and registered your name the first morning after you came here! If you run against him\u2014well, you mustn\u2019t, that\u2019s all!\u201d McMurdo showed mild surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the lodge for over two years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as all that.\u201d \u201cMaybe not in Chicago.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s the same society here.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d Scanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There was something sinister in his eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me that in a month\u2019s time. I hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after I left the train.\u201d \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d \u201cOh, it got about\u2014things do get about for good and for bad in this district.\u201d \u201cWell, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of them.\u201d \u201cBy the Lord, you\u2019ll be a man after McGinty\u2019s heart!\u201d \u201cWhat, does he hate the police too?\u201d Scanlan burst out laughing. \u201cYou go and see him, my lad,\u201d said he as he took his leave. \u201cIt\u2019s not the police but you that he\u2019ll hate if you don\u2019t! Now, take a friend\u2019s advice and go at once!\u201d It chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing interview which urged him in the same direction. It may have been that his attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German host; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the young man into his private room and started on the subject without any circumlocution. \u201cIt seems to me, mister,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you are gettin\u2019 set on my Ettie.

Are there not fifty murders to prove it? Vat about Milman and Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little Billy James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?\u201d \u201cSee here!\u201d said McMurdo earnestly. \u201cI want you to take back what you\u2019ve said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before I quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in the town. I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one. You\u2019ll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always as an innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers.

Is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare not turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!\u201d McMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles into her ear. \u201cSure, your father is after giving me notice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s little I would care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it\u2019s only a week that I\u2019ve known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and I can\u2019t live without you!\u201d \u201cOh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don\u2019t speak so!\u201d said the girl. \u201cI have told you, have I not, that you are too late? There is another, and if I have not promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.\u201d \u201cSuppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?\u201d The girl sank her face into her hands. \u201cI wish to heaven that you had been first!\u201d she sobbed. McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Ettie, let it stand at that!\u201d he cried. \u201cWill you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your heart, acushla! \u2019Tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying.\u201d He had seized Ettie\u2019s white hand between his own strong brown ones. \u201cSay that you will be mine, and we will face it out together!\u201d \u201cNot here?\u201d \u201cYes, here.\u201d \u201cNo, no, Jack!\u201d His arms were round her now. \u201cIt could not be here.

It\u2019s mad on the face of it! If these men, as your father says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if everyone knows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice? You answer me that, Ettie!\u201d \u201cBecause no witness dares to appear against them. He would not live a month if he did. Also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. But surely, Jack, you must have read all this. I had understood that every paper in the United States was writing about it.\u201d \u201cWell, I have read something, it is true; but I had thought it was a story. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. Maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves.\u201d \u201cOh, Jack, don\u2019t let me hear you speak so! That is how he speaks\u2014the other one!\u201d \u201cBaldwin\u2014he speaks like that, does he?\u201d \u201cAnd that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the truth. I loathe him with all my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him for myself; but above all I fear him for father. I know that some great sorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. That is why I have put him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our only hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men.\u201d Again there was the struggle upon McMurdo\u2019s face, and again it set like granite. \u201cNo harm shall come to you, Ettie\u2014nor to your father either.

Mr. McMurdo, may I introduce you to Mr. Baldwin?\u201d The young men nodded in surly fashion to each other. \u201cMaybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that there was any relation between you.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you? Well, you can understand it now. You can take it from me that this young lady is mine, and you\u2019ll find it a very fine evening for a walk.\u201d \u201cThank you, I am in no humour for a walk.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d The man\u2019s savage eyes were blazing with anger. \u201cMaybe you are in a humour for a fight, Mr. Boarder!\u201d \u201cThat I am!\u201d cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. \u201cYou never said a more welcome word.\u201d \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jack! Oh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d cried poor, distracted Ettie. \u201cOh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s Jack, is it?\u201d said Baldwin with an oath. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to that already, have you?\u201d \u201cOh, Ted, be reasonable\u2014be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved me, be big-hearted and forgiving!\u201d \u201cI think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled,\u201d said McMurdo quietly. \u201cOr maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will take a turn down the street with me. It\u2019s a fine evening, and there\u2019s some open ground beyond the next block.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,\u201d said his enemy. \u201cYou\u2019ll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am through with you!\u201d \u201cNo time like the present,\u201d cried McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019ll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me. See here!\u201d He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. It was a circle with a triangle within it. \u201cD\u2019you know what that means?\u201d \u201cI neither know nor care!\u201d \u201cWell, you will know, I\u2019ll promise you that.

For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw her arms around him. \u201cOh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly! To-night\u2014Jack\u2014to-night! It\u2019s your only hope. He will have your life. I read it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against a dozen of them, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them?\u201d McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back into a chair. \u201cThere, acushla, there! Don\u2019t be disturbed or fear for me. I\u2019m a Freeman myself. I\u2019m after telling your father about it. Maybe I am no better than the others; so don\u2019t make a saint of me. Perhaps you hate me too, now that I\u2019ve told you as much?\u201d \u201cHate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never do that! I\u2019ve heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh, hurry, Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on your trail.\u201d \u201cI was thinking the same thing,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019ll go right now and fix it. You can tell your father that I\u2019ll sleep here to-night and find some other quarters in the morning.\u201d The bar of McGinty\u2019s saloon was crowded as usual; for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The man was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this popularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none could afford to neglect his good will. Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a municipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads, elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the public works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him.

Assessments and taxes were enormous; the public works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him. Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty\u2019s diamond pins became more obtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest, and his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market Square. McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place was brilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination. There were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad, brass-trimmed counter. At the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong, heavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty himself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complexion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange dead black, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly sinister appearance. All else in the man\u2014his noble proportions, his fine features, and his frank bearing\u2014fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only when those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly. Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss, laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young stranger\u2019s bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him. \u201cWell, young man, I can\u2019t call your face to mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m new here, Mr. McGinty.\u201d \u201cYou are not so new that you can\u2019t give a gentleman his proper title.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s Councillor McGinty, young man,\u201d said a voice from the group. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Councillor.

[Illustration: \u201cIf your heart is as big as your body, and your soul as fine as your face, then I\u2019d ask for nothing better,\u201d said McMurdo.] \u201cBy Gar! you\u2019ve got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,\u201d cried the saloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity. \u201cSo you are good enough to pass my appearance?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cAnd you were told to see me?\u201d \u201cI was.\u201d \u201cAnd who told you?\u201d \u201cBrother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health Councillor, and to our better acquaintance.\u201d He raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it. McGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black eyebrows. \u201cOh, it\u2019s like that, is it?\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019ll have to look a bit closer into this, Mister\u2014\u201d \u201cMcMurdo.\u201d \u201cA bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don\u2019t take folk on trust in these parts, nor believe all we\u2019re told neither. Come in here for a moment, behind the bar.\u201d There was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty carefully closed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence. McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket, the other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver. \u201cSee here, my joker,\u201d said he, \u201cif I thought you were playing any game on us, it would be short work for you.\u201d \u201cThis is a strange welcome,\u201d McMurdo answered with some dignity, \u201cfor the Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.\u201d \u201cAy, but it\u2019s just that same that you have to prove,\u201d said McGinty, \u201cand God help you if you fail!

I spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands. Look at that clipping.\u201d McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week of 1874. \u201cYour work?\u201d he asked, as he handed back the paper. McMurdo nodded. \u201cWhy did you shoot him?\u201d \u201cI was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good gold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. This man Pinto helped me to shove the queer\u2014\u201d \u201cTo do what?\u201d \u201cWell, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he said he would split. Maybe he did split. I didn\u2019t wait to see. I just killed him and lighted out for the coal country.\u201d \u201cWhy the coal country?\u201d \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019d read in the papers that they weren\u2019t too particular in those parts.\u201d McGinty laughed. \u201cYou were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you came to these parts because you thought you\u2019d be welcome.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll go far. Say, can you make those dollars yet?\u201d McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. \u201cThose never passed the Philadelphia mint,\u201d said he. \u201cYou don\u2019t say!\u201d McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand, which was hairy as a gorilla\u2019s. \u201cI can see no difference.

Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d cried Baldwin in a fury. \u201cI\u2019ve offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019ll fight him with fists, or, if that won\u2019t satisfy him, I\u2019ll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I\u2019ll leave it to you, Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.\u201d \u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d \u201cA young lady. She\u2019s free to choose for herself.\u201d \u201cIs she?\u201d cried Baldwin. \u201cAs between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,\u201d said the Boss. \u201cOh, that\u2019s your ruling, is it?\u201d \u201cYes, it is, Ted Baldwin,\u201d said McGinty, with a wicked stare. \u201cIs it you that would dispute it?\u201d \u201cYou would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?

{"text": "Chapter III Lodge 341, Vermissa On the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter\u2019s and took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara\u2019s on the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together. There was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old Irishwoman who left them to themselves; so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common. Shafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals there when he liked; so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means broken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by. In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it safe to take out the coining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions; though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track. One policeman was indeed after him already; but the incident, as luck would have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm. After the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to McGinty\u2019s saloon, there to make closer acquaintance with \u201cthe boys,\u201d which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to one another. His dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all; while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an \u201call in\u201d bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community. Another incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation. Just at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district. There was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at him; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the States, and McGinty himself, standing behind his counter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers. \u201cA straight whisky; for the night is bitter,\u201d said the police officer. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have met before, Councillor?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be the new", "chapter": "III\nLodge 341, Vermissa"}

We\u2019re looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading citizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township. Captain Marvin is my name.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d do better without you, Captain Marvin,\u201d said McGinty coldly; \u201cfor we have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported goods. What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?\u201d \u201cWell, well, we won\u2019t argue about that,\u201d said the police officer good-humouredly. \u201cI expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we can\u2019t all see it the same.\u201d He had drunk off his glass and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his elbow. \u201cHullo! Hullo!\u201d he cried, looking him up and down. \u201cHere\u2019s an old acquaintance!\u201d McMurdo shrank away from him. \u201cI was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life,\u201d said he. \u201cAn acquaintance isn\u2019t always a friend,\u201d said the police captain, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re Jack McMurdo of Chicago, right enough, and don\u2019t you deny it!\u201d McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not denying it,\u201d said he. \u201cD\u2019ye think I\u2019m ashamed of my own name?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got good cause to be, anyhow.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil d\u2019you mean by that?\u201d he roared with his fists clenched. \u201cNo, no, Jack, bluster won\u2019t do with me. I was an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook when I see one.\u201d McMurdo\u2019s face fell. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re Marvin of the Chicago Central!\u201d he cried. \u201cJust the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven\u2019t forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.\u201d \u201cI never shot him.\u201d \u201cDid you not? That\u2019s good impartial evidence, ain\u2019t it? Well, his death came in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving the queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and me\u2014and perhaps I\u2019m going further than my duty in saying it\u2014they could get no clear case against you, and Chicago\u2019s open to you to-morrow.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very well where I am.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ve given you the pointer, and you\u2019re a sulky dog not to thank me for it.\u201d \u201cWell, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,\u201d said McMurdo in no very gracious manner. \u201cIt\u2019s mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBut, by the Lord! if you get off after this, it\u2019s another story!

So good-night to you\u2014and good-night, Councillor.\u201d He left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero. McMurdo\u2019s deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before. He had put off all questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him. But now the thing was officially confirmed. The bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand. He was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and show little trace of it; but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar. On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge. He had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but there were particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these had to be undergone by every postulant. The assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the Union House. Some sixty members assembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in the valley, and others across the mountains on each side, who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality. Altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district. In the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes. McGinty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. To right and left of him were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted Baldwin among them. Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office. They were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors. Among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish, lawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business, and", "chapter": "III\nLodge 341, Vermissa"}

The crime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man. At first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open, for the repeated failure of the law had proved to them that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against them, and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon whom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state. In ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and the only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim himself\u2014who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants. McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him; but no one would tell him in what it consisted. He was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy. Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest. \u201cThe Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,\u201d said he. The three of them removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right arm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast. They next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face, so that he could see nothing. He was then led into the assembly hall. It was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood. He heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of McGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears. \u201cJohn McMurdo,\u201d said the voice, \u201care you already a member of the Ancient Order of Freemen?\u201d He bowed in assent. \u201cIs your lodge No. 29, Chicago?\u201d He bowed again. \u201cDark nights are unpleasant,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYes, for strangers to travel,\u201d he", "chapter": "III\nLodge 341, Vermissa"}

There was a general murmur of assent. \u201cWe know, Brother, by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cWe would have you know, however, that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites, and also certain duties of our own which call for good men. Are you ready to be tested?\u201d \u201cI am.\u201d \u201cAre you of stout heart?\u201d \u201cI am.\u201d \u201cTake a stride forward to prove it.\u201d As the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved himself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. There was a low murmur of applause. \u201cHe is of stout heart,\u201d said the voice. \u201cCan you bear pain?\u201d \u201cAs well as another,\u201d he answered. \u201cTest him!\u201d It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony. [Illustration: It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out.] \u201cI can take more than that,\u201d said he. This time there was loud applause. A finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was plucked from his head. He stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers. \u201cOne last word, Brother McMurdo,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cYou have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cAnd you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cThen in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its privileges and debates. You will put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.\u201d McMurdo\u2019s coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he examined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as the branding iron had left it.

It was nothing,\u201d said he; but it burned and ached all the same. When the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of, the business of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed only to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed. \u201cThe first business on the agenda paper,\u201d said McGinty, \u201cis to read the following letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249. He says: \u201c\u2018DEAR SIR.\u2014\u201cThere is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash, coal owners near this place. You will remember that your lodge owes us a return, having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall. You will send two good men, they will be taken charge of by Treasurer Higgins of this lodge, whose address you know. He will show them when to act and where. Yours in freedom, \u201c\u2018J.W. WINDLE, D.M.A.O.F.\u2019\u201d \u201cWindle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.\u201d McGinty paused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. \u201cWho will volunteer for the job?\u201d Several young fellows held up their hands. The Bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as well as you did the last, you won\u2019t be wrong. And you, Wilson.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve no pistol,\u201d said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens. \u201cIt\u2019s your first, is it not? Well, you have to be blooded some time. It will be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you\u2019ll find it waiting for you, or I\u2019m mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday, it will be time enough. You\u2019ll get a great welcome when you return.\u201d \u201cAny reward this time?\u201d asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark-faced, brutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of \u201cTiger.\u201d \u201cNever mind the reward. You just do it for the honour of the thing. Maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.\u201d \u201cWhat has the man done?\u201d asked young Wilson. \u201cSure, it\u2019s not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. He has been judged over there. That\u2019s no business of ours. All we have to do is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us.

If you know nothing, you can testify nothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it.\u201d \u201cAnd time, too!\u201d cried Ted Baldwin. \u201cFolk are gettin\u2019 out of hand in these parts. It was only last week that three of our men were turned off by Foreman Blaker. It\u2019s been owing him a long time, and he\u2019ll get it full and proper.\u201d \u201cGet what?\u201d McMurdo whispered to his neighbour. \u201cThe business end of a buckshot cartridge!\u201d cried the man with a loud laugh. \u201cWhat think you of our ways, Brother?\u201d McMurdo\u2019s criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member. \u201cI like it well,\u201d said he. \u201c\u2019Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.\u201d Several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the table. \u201c\u2019Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.\u201d McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. \u201cI would say, Eminent Bodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge.\u201d There was great applause at this. It was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid. \u201cI would move,\u201d said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the chairman, \u201cthat Brother McMurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.\u201d \u201cSure, that was what I meant; I\u2019m in your hands,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cYour time will come, Brother,\u201d said the chairman. \u201cWe have marked you down as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in these parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a hand if it so please you.\u201d \u201cI will wait for something that is worth while.\u201d \u201cYou can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community. I will make the announcement later. Meanwhile,\u201d he glanced at his agenda paper, \u201cI have one or two more points to bring before the meeting. First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim Carnaway\u2019s widow.

Max Linder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker Brothers sent in a hundred; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. If I do not hear by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of order. We had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. Then the West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. We have enough on hand to meet any obligations.\u201d \u201cWhat about Archie Swindon?\u201d asked a brother. \u201cHe has sold out and left the district. The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! I guess he won\u2019t show his face in this valley again.\u201d An elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman. \u201cMr. Treasurer,\u201d he asked, \u201cmay I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district?\u201d \u201cYes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the State & Merton County Railroad Company.\u201d \u201cAnd who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the market in the same way last year?\u201d \u201cThe same company, Brother Morris.\u201d \u201cAnd who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?\u201d \u201cThey were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see, Brother Morris,\u201d said the chairman, \u201cthat it matters to us who buys them, since they can\u2019t carry them out of the district.\u201d \u201cWith all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think it may matter very much to us. This process has been going on now for ten long years. We are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the result? We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or the General Iron, who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia, and care nothing for our threats.

We can take it out of their local bosses; but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. And we are making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men could not harm us. They had not the money nor the power. So long as we did not squeeze them too dry, they would stay on under our power. But if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.\u201d There was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds. And yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them. \u201cIt is my advice,\u201d the speaker continued, \u201cthat we go easier upon the small men. On the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken.\u201d Unwelcome truths are not popular. There were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat. McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow. \u201cBrother Morris,\u201d said he, \u201cyou were always a croaker. So long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United States that can touch them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in the lawcourts? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight, same as the little companies do. And now, Brethren,\u201d McGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke, \u201cthis lodge has finished its business for the evening, save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting. The time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.\u201d Strange indeed is human nature. Here were these men, to whom murder was familiar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family, some man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears. McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with \u201cI\u2019m Sitting on the Stile, Mary,\u201d and \u201cOn the Banks of Allan Water.\u201d In his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high office.

There were other qualities needed, however, besides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an example before the evening was over. The whisky bottle had passed round many times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their Bodymaster rose once more to address them. \u201cBoys,\u201d said he, \u201cthere\u2019s one man in this town that wants trimming up, and it\u2019s for you to see that he gets it. I\u2019m speaking of James Stanger of the Herald. You\u2019ve seen how he\u2019s been opening his mouth against us again?\u201d There was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. McGinty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket. \u201c\u2018Law and Order!\u2019 That\u2019s how he heads it. \u2018Reign of Terror in the Coal and Iron District. Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst. From that day these outrages have never ceased, until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world. Is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of Europe? Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the East? The men are known. The organization is patent and public. How long are we to endure it? Can we forever live\u2014\u2019 Sure, I\u2019ve read enough of the slush!\u201d cried the chairman, tossing the paper down upon the table. \u201cThat\u2019s what he says of us. The question I\u2019m asking you is what shall we say to him?\u201d \u201cKill him!\u201d cried a dozen fierce voices. \u201cI protest against that,\u201d said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow and shaved face. \u201cI tell you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in this valley, and that there will come a point where in self-defense every man will unite to crush us out. James Stanger is an old man. He is respected in the township and the district. His paper stands for all that is solid in the valley.

A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion. \u201cI have but to raise my finger,\u201d cried McGinty, \u201cand I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.\u201d Then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown, \u201cSee here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and have had for some time! You\u2019ve no heart yourself, and you try to take the heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris, when your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s just there that I ought to place it.\u201d Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer. \u201cI apologize, Eminent Bodymaster, to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said more than I should. I am a faithful member\u2014you all know that\u2014and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words. But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.\u201d The Bodymaster\u2019s scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words. \u201cVery good, Brother Morris. It\u2019s myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed. And now, boys,\u201d he continued, looking round at the company, \u201cI\u2019ll say this much, that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for. These editors hang together, and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops. But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?\u201d \u201cSure!\u201d said the young man eagerly. \u201cHow many will you take?\u201d \u201cHalf a dozen, and two to guard the door. You\u2019ll come, Gower, and you, Mansel, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.\u201d \u201cI promised the new brother he should go,\u201d said the chairman.

The sooner we get to work the better.\u201d The company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren remained there. The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night, with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The words, \u201cVermissa Herald\u201d were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing press. \u201cHere, you,\u201d said Baldwin to McMurdo, \u201cyou can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with you. You others come with me. Have no fears, boys; for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.\u201d It was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing open the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below. From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing. He was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo\u2019s feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was on his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the blows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the man\u2019s head, which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms. His white hair was dabbled with patches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill the man,\u201d said he. \u201cDrop it!\u201d Baldwin looked at him in amazement. \u201cCurse you!\u201d he cried. \u201cWho are you to interfere\u2014you that are new to the lodge? Stand back!\u201d He raised his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his pocket. \u201cStand back yourself!\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019ll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me. As to the lodge, wasn\u2019t it the order of the Bodymaster that the man was not to be killed\u2014and what are you doing but killing him?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s truth he says,\u201d remarked one of the men. \u201cBy Gar! you\u2019d", "chapter": "III\nLodge 341, Vermissa"}

Leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union House, some of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty\u2019s saloon, whispering across the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through.

{"text": "Chapter IV The Valley of Fear When McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink, and his arm, where he had been branded, was hot and swollen. Having his own peculiar source of income, he was irregular in his attendance at his work; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend. Afterwards he read the Daily Herald. In a special column put in at the last moment he read, \u201cOutrage at the Herald Office\u2014Editor Seriously Injured.\u201d It was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been. It ended with the statement: The matter is now in the hands of the police; but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past. Some of the men were recognized, and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained. The source of the outrage was, it need hardly be said, that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period, and against which the Herald has taken so uncompromising a stand. Mr. Stanger\u2019s many friends will rejoice to hear that, though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten, and though he has sustained severe injuries about the head, there is no immediate danger to his life. Below it stated that a guard of police, armed with Winchester rifles, had been requisitioned for the defense of the office. McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there was a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus: I should wish to speak to you, but would rather not do so in your house. You will find me beside the flagstaff upon Miller Hill. If you will come there now, I have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say. McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it. Had it been in a feminine hand, he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life. But it was the writing of a man, and of a well educated one, too. Finally, after some hesitation, he determined to see the matter through. Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town. In summer it is a favourite resort of the people, but in winter it is desolate enough. From the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling, grimy town, but of the winding valley beneath, with its scattered mines and factories blackening the", "chapter": "IV\nThe Valley of Fear"}

From the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling, grimy town, but of the winding valley beneath, with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of it, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it. McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety. Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath it a man, his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up. When he turned his face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had incurred the anger of the Bodymaster the night before. The lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met. \u201cI wanted to have a word with you, Mr. McMurdo,\u201d said the older man, speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground. \u201cIt was kind of you to come.\u201d \u201cWhy did you not put your name to the note?\u201d \u201cOne has to be cautious, mister. One never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one. One never knows either who to trust or who not to trust.\u201d \u201cSurely one may trust brothers of the lodge.\u201d \u201cNo, no, not always,\u201d cried Morris with vehemence. \u201cWhatever we say, even what we think, seems to go back to that man McGinty.\u201d \u201cLook here!\u201d said McMurdo sternly. \u201cIt was only last night, as you know well, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be asking me to break my oath?\u201d \u201cIf that is the view you take,\u201d said Morris sadly, \u201cI can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me. Things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other.\u201d McMurdo, who had been watching his companion very narrowly, relaxed somewhat in his bearing. \u201cSure I spoke for myself only,\u201d said he. \u201cI am a newcomer, as you know, and I am strange to it all. It is not for me to open my mouth, Mr. Morris, and if you think well to say anything to me I am here to hear it.\u201d \u201cAnd to take it back to Boss McGinty!\u201d said Morris bitterly. \u201cIndeed, then, you do me injustice there,\u201d cried McMurdo. \u201cFor myself I am loyal to the lodge, and so I tell you straight; but I would be a poor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence. It will go no further than me; though I warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy.\u201d \u201cI have given up looking for either the one or the other,\u201d said Morris. \u201cI may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say; but, bad", "chapter": "IV\nThe Valley of Fear"}

That was why I thought to speak with you.\u201d \u201cWell, what have you to say?\u201d \u201cIf you give me away, may a curse be on you!\u201d \u201cSure, I said I would not.\u201d \u201cI would ask you, then, when you joined the Freeman\u2019s society in Chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime?\u201d \u201cIf you call it crime,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cCall it crime!\u201d cried Morris, his voice vibrating with passion. \u201cYou have seen little of it if you can call it anything else. Was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs? Was that crime\u2014or what else would you call it?\u201d \u201cThere are some would say it was war,\u201d said McMurdo, \u201ca war of two classes with all in, so that each struck as best it could.\u201d \u201cWell, did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freeman\u2019s society at Chicago?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m bound to say I did not.\u201d \u201cNor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one\u2019s fellows. Then I heard of this place\u2014curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears!\u2014and I came to better myself! My God! to better myself! My wife and three children came with me. I started a drygoods store on Market Square, and I prospered well. The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. I\u2019ve the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart. I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night. I can\u2019t get away; for all I have in the world is in my store. If I leave the society, I know well that it means murder to me, and God knows what to my wife and children. Oh, man, it is awful\u2014awful!\u201d He put his hands to his face, and his body shook with convulsive sobs.

I was chosen for a job. If I backed down I knew well what would come to me. Maybe I\u2019m a coward. Maybe it\u2019s the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess it will haunt me forever. \u201cIt was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder. I was told off for the door, same as you were last night. They could not trust me with the job. The others went in. When they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered. I nearly fainted with the horror of it, and yet I had to keep a bold and smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his father. \u201cBut I was a criminal then, part sharer in a murder, lost forever in this world, and lost also in the next. I am a good Catholic; but the priest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer, and I am excommunicated from my faith. That\u2019s how it stands with me. And I see you going down the same road, and I ask you what the end is to be. Are you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also, or can we do anything to stop it?\u201d \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d asked McMurdo abruptly. \u201cYou would not inform?\u201d \u201cGod forbid!\u201d cried Morris. \u201cSure, the very thought would cost me my life.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter.\u201d \u201cToo much! Wait till you have lived here longer. Look down the valley! See the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people. It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death. The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn.

I\u2019ll bear what you have said in mind, and maybe some day I\u2019ll come back to it. I expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this. Now I\u2019ll be getting home.\u201d \u201cOne word before you go,\u201d said Morris. \u201cWe may have been seen together.

Well, so long, Brother Morris, and may you find things go better with you in the future.\u201d That same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smoking, lost in thought beside the stove of his sitting-room, the door swung open and its framework was filled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty. He passed the sign, and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI guess I am too busy over the folk that visit me. But I thought I\u2019d stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to see you here, Councillor,\u201d McMurdo answered heartily, bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour that I had not expected.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d asked the Boss. McMurdo made a wry face. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not forgetting it,\u201d he said; \u201cbut it\u2019s worth it.\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d the other answered, \u201cto those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge. What were you speaking to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?\u201d The question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared. He burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cMorris didn\u2019t know I could earn a living here at home. He shan\u2019t know either; for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me. But he\u2019s a good-hearted old chap. It was his idea that I was at a loose end, and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store.\u201d \u201cOh, that was it?\u201d \u201cYes, that was it.\u201d \u201cAnd you refused it?\u201d \u201cSure. Couldn\u2019t I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours\u2019 work?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so.

Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous, insincere fashion. \u201cYou\u2019re a queer card, for sure,\u201d said he. \u201cWell, if you want reasons, I\u2019ll give them. Did Morris say nothing to you against the lodge?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor against me?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s because he daren\u2019t trust you. But in his heart he is not a loyal brother. We know that well. So we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him. I\u2019m thinking that the time is drawing near. There\u2019s no room for scabby sheep in our pen. But if you keep company with a disloyal man, we might think that you were disloyal, too. See?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of my keeping company with him; for I dislike the man,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cAs to being disloyal, if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said McGinty, draining off his glass. \u201cI came down to give you a word in season, and you\u2019ve had it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to know,\u201d said McMurdo, \u201chow you ever came to learn that I had spoken with Morris at all?\u201d McGinty laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s my business to know what goes on in this township,\u201d said he. \u201cI guess you\u2019d best reckon on my hearing all that passes. Well, time\u2019s up, and I\u2019ll just say\u2014\u201d But his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion. With a sudden crash the door flew open, and three frowning, intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps. McMurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver; but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled at his head. A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his hand. It was Captain Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine Constabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of Chicago,\u201d said he. \u201cCan\u2019t keep out of it, can you?

It is for you to help, not to hinder us in our duty.\u201d \u201cHe is a friend of mine, and I\u2019ll answer for his conduct,\u201d said the Boss. \u201cBy all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days,\u201d the captain answered. \u201cThis man McMurdo was a crook before ever he came here, and he\u2019s a crook still. Cover him, Patrolman, while I disarm him.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s my pistol,\u201d said McMurdo coolly. \u201cMaybe, Captain Marvin, if you and I were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s your warrant?\u201d asked McGinty. \u201cBy Gar! a man might as well live in Russia as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the police. It\u2019s a capitalist outrage, and you\u2019ll hear more of it, I reckon.\u201d \u201cYou do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor. We\u2019ll look after ours.\u201d \u201cWhat am I accused of?\u201d asked McMurdo. \u201cOf being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the Herald office. It wasn\u2019t your fault that it isn\u2019t a murder charge.\u201d \u201cWell, if that\u2019s all you have against him,\u201d cried McGinty with a laugh, \u201cyou can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now. This man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight, and I can bring a dozen to prove it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s your affair, and I guess you can settle it in court to-morrow. Meanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don\u2019t want a gun across your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty; for I warn you I will stand no resistance when I am on duty!\u201d So determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and his boss were forced to accept the situation. The latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted. \u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant. \u201cAll right,\u201d whispered McMurdo, who had devised a safe hiding place under the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll bid you good-bye,\u201d said the Boss, shaking hands. \u201cI\u2019ll see Reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself. Take my word for it that they won\u2019t be able to hold you.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on that. Guard the prisoner, you two, and shoot him if he tries any games. I\u2019ll search the house before I leave.\u201d He did so; but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant. When he had descended he and his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters.

Darkness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the streets were nearly deserted; but a few loiterers followed the group, and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner. \u201cLynch the cursed Scowrer!\u201d they cried. \u201cLynch him!\u201d They laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station. After a short, formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common cell. Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night before, all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next morning. But even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the Freemen was able to extend. Late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding, out of which he extracted two bottles of whisky, some glasses, and a pack of cards. They spent a hilarious night, without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning. Nor had they cause, as the result was to show. The magistrate could not possibly, on the evidence, have held them for a higher court. On the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain, that they were themselves much perturbed, and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants; although they believed that the accused were among them. Cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they were even more nebulous in their evidence. The injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache. He added that he knew them to be Scowrers, since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him, and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials. On the other hand, it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens, including that high municipal official, Councillor McGinty, that the men had been at a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage. Needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put, together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police for their officious zeal. The verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo saw many familiar faces. Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved.

But there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded, resolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him. \u201cYou damned murderers!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix you yet!\u201d", "chapter": "IV\nThe Valley of Fear"}
{"text": "Chapter V The Darkest Hour If anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo\u2019s popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and acquittal. That a man on the very night of joining the lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society. Already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and withal a man of high temper, who would not take an insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme, or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the boy for the clean job,\u201d said the oldsters to one another, and waited their time until they could set him to his work. McGinty had instruments enough already; but he recognized that this was a supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey. A few members of the lodge, Ted Baldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it; but they kept clear of him, for he was as ready to fight as to laugh. But if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another quarter, one which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie Shafter\u2019s father would have nothing more to do with him, nor would he allow him to enter the house. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether, and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal. One morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him, possibly for the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down. She went to his house, as he had often begged her to do, and made her way into the room which he used as his sitting-room. He was seated at a table, with his back turned and a letter in front of him. A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her\u2014she was still only nineteen. He had not heard her when she pushed open the door. Now she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders. If she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but only in turn to be startled herself. With a tiger spring he turned on her, and his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the same instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him. For an instant he stood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features\u2014a ferocity", "chapter": "V\nThe Darkest Hour"}

Then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features\u2014a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d said he, mopping his brow. \u201cAnd to think that you should come to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you! Come then, darling,\u201d and he held out his arms, \u201clet me make it up to you.\u201d But she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the man\u2019s face. All her woman\u2019s instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled. Guilt\u2014that was it\u2014guilt and fear! \u201cWhat\u2019s come over you, Jack?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy were you so scared of me? Oh, Jack, if your conscience was at ease, you would not have looked at me like that!\u201d \u201cSure, I was thinking of other things, and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, it was more than that, Jack.\u201d Then a sudden suspicion seized her. \u201cLet me see that letter you were writing.\u201d \u201cAh, Ettie, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Her suspicions became certainties. \u201cIt\u2019s to another woman,\u201d she cried. \u201cI know it! Why else should you hold it from me? Was it to your wife that you were writing? How am I to know that you are not a married man\u2014you, a stranger, that nobody knows?\u201d \u201cI am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it! You\u2019re the only one woman on earth to me. By the cross of Christ I swear it!\u201d He was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him. \u201cWell, then,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhy will you not show me the letter?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, acushla,\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019m under oath not to show it, and just as I wouldn\u2019t break my word to you so I would keep it to those who hold my promise. It\u2019s the business of the lodge, and even to you it\u2019s secret. And if I was scared when a hand fell on me, can\u2019t you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective?\u201d She felt that he was telling the truth. He gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts. \u201cSit here by me, then. It\u2019s a queer throne for such a queen; but it\u2019s the best your poor lover can find.

It went through my heart like a knife.\u201d \u201cSure, hard words break no bones.\u201d \u201cBut they were true.\u201d \u201cWell, dear, it\u2019s not so bad as you think. We are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights.\u201d Ettie threw her arms round her lover\u2019s neck. \u201cGive it up, Jack! For my sake, for God\u2019s sake, give it up!

How could I give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades? If you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me. Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it? You don\u2019t suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve thought of that, Jack. I\u2019ve planned it all. Father has saved some money. He is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together to Philadelphia or New York, where we would be safe from them.\u201d McMurdo laughed. \u201cThe lodge has a long arm. Do you think it could not stretch from here to Philadelphia or New York?\u201d \u201cWell, then, to the West, or to England, or to Germany, where father came from\u2014anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear!\u201d McMurdo thought of old Brother Morris. \u201cSure, it is the second time I have heard the valley so named,\u201d said he. \u201cThe shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you.\u201d \u201cIt darkens every moment of our lives. Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin has ever forgiven us? If it were not that he fears you, what do you suppose our chances would be?

But if you\u2019ll give me six months, I\u2019ll work it so that I can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face.\u201d The girl laughed with joy. \u201cSix months!\u201d she cried. \u201cIs it a promise?\u201d \u201cWell, it may be seven or eight. But within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us.\u201d It was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something. There was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future. She returned to her father\u2019s house more light-hearted than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life. It might be thought that as a member, all the doings of the society would be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to many things; for there was an official named the County Delegate, living at Hobson\u2019s Patch farther down the line, who had power over several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a sly, little gray-haired rat of a man, with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the great Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre. One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo\u2019s fellow boarder, received a note from McGinty inclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him that he was sending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given. Would the Bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive? McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House, and that, therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding house. The same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his gripsack. Lawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in an old black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and ragged, grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher.

His companion Andrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced and cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society, with the one simple exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this association of murder. Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three. They were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community. They were reticent, however, as to the immediate job in hand. \u201cThey chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,\u201d Lawler explained. \u201cThey can count on us saying no more than we should. You must not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County Delegate that we obey.\u201d \u201cSure, we are all in it together,\u201d said Scanlan, McMurdo\u2019s mate, as the four sat together at supper. \u201cThat\u2019s true enough, and we\u2019ll talk till the cows come home of the killing of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird, or any other job in the past. But till the work is done we say nothing.\u201d \u201cThere are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,\u201d said McMurdo, with an oath. \u201cI suppose it isn\u2019t Jack Knox of Ironhill that you are after. I\u2019d go some way to see him get his deserts.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not him yet.\u201d \u201cOr Herman Strauss?\u201d \u201cNo, nor him either.\u201d \u201cWell, if you won\u2019t tell us we can\u2019t make you; but I\u2019d be glad to know.\u201d Lawler smiled and shook his head. He was not to be drawn. In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called \u201cthe fun.\u201d When, therefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping down the stairs he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their clothes. When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out, leaving the door open behind them. It was not yet dawn, and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street. They followed them warily, treading noiselessly in the deep snow. The boarding house was near the edge of the town, and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary.

Here three men were waiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager conversation. Then they all moved on together. It was clearly some notable job which needed numbers. At this point there are several trails which lead to various mines. The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill, a huge business which was in strong hands which had been able, thanks to their energetic and fearless New England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror. Day was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their way, singly and in groups, along the blackened path. McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of the men whom they followed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. It was the ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day\u2019s labour began. When they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers; for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them. They saw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies, come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered. At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a clean-shaved, earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head. As he came forward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and motionless, under the engine house. The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces. For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its cold hand upon the manager\u2019s heart. At the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked as he advanced. \u201cWhat are you loitering there for?\u201d There was no answer; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up. Then he staggered away; but another of the assassins fired, and he went down sidewise, kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers; but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their very feet. There was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their six-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they", "chapter": "V\nThe Darkest Hour"}

There was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their six-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they broke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in Vermissa. When a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to the mine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning, without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime. Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back; Scanlan somewhat subdued, for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes, and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe. The horrible screams of the dead manager\u2019s wife pursued them as they hurried to the town. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion. \u201cSure, it is like a war,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat is it but a war between us and them, and we hit back where we best can.\u201d There was high revel in the lodge room at the Union House that night, not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill mine, which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district, but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge itself. It would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five good men to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that in return three Vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill William Hales of Stake Royal, one of the best known and most popular mine owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed not to have an enemy in the world; for he was in all ways a model employer. He had insisted, however, upon efficiency in the work, and had, therefore, paid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the all-powerful society. Coffin notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country he found himself condemned to death. The execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of the party. His flushed face and glazed, bloodshot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades had spent the night before among the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-stained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades. The story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter.

But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades. The story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter. They had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall, taking their station at the top of a steep hill, where his horse must be at a walk. He was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot him again and again. He had screamed for mercy. The screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge. \u201cLet\u2019s hear again how he squealed,\u201d they cried. None of them knew the man; but there is eternal drama in a killing, and they had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were to be relied upon. There had been one contretemps; for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. It had been suggested that they should shoot them both; but they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall them. And so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to all such hard-hearted employers, and the three noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heaps. Here they were, safe and sound, their work well done, and the plaudits of their companions in their ears. It had been a great day for the Scowrers. The shadow had fallen even darker over the valley. But as the wise general chooses the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss McGinty, looking out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes, had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him. That very night, as the half-drunken company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and led him aside into that inner room where they had their first interview. \u201cSee here, my lad,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ve got a job that\u2019s worthy of you at last. You\u2019ll have the doing of it in your own hands.\u201d \u201cProud I am to hear it,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cYou can take two men with you\u2014Manders and Reilly. They have been warned for service. We\u2019ll never be right in this district until Chester Wilcox has been settled, and you\u2019ll have the thanks of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down him.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, anyhow.

Who is he, and where shall I find him?\u201d McGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the corner of his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook. \u201cHe\u2019s the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He\u2019s a hard citizen, an old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. We\u2019ve had two tries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it. Now it\u2019s for you to take it over. That\u2019s the house\u2014all alone at the Iron Dike crossroad, same as you see here on the map\u2014without another within earshot. It\u2019s no good by day. He\u2019s armed and shoots quick and straight, with no questions asked. But at night\u2014well, there he is with his wife, three children, and a hired help. You can\u2019t pick or choose. It\u2019s all or none.

Carnaway was about his house at night, and he shot him. That\u2019s enough for me and you. You\u2019ve got to settle the thing right.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s these two women and the children. Do they go up too?\u201d \u201cThey have to\u2014else how can we get him?\u201d \u201cIt seems hard on them; for they\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of fool\u2019s talk is this? Do you back out?\u201d \u201cEasy, Councillor, easy! What have I ever said or done that you should think I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of my own lodge? If it\u2019s right or if it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s for you to decide.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll do it, then?\u201d \u201cOf course I will do it.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cWell, you had best give me a night or two that I may see the house and make my plans. Then\u2014\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. \u201cI leave it with you. It will be a great day when you bring us the news. It\u2019s just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees.\u201d McMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so suddenly placed in his hands. The isolated house in which Chester Wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley. That very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt. It was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance. Next day he interviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt.

Next day he interviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt. Two nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the quarries. It was two in the morning before they came to the lonely house. The night was a windy one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a three-quarter moon. They had been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds; so they moved forward cautiously, with their pistols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound save the howling of the wind, and no movement but the swaying branches above them. McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still within. Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it with his knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well alight he and his two companions took to their heels, and were some distance off, safe and snug in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of the explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the collapsing building, told them that their work was done. No cleaner job had ever been carried out in the bloodstained annals of the society. But alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all have gone for nothing! Warned by the fate of the various victims, and knowing that he was marked down for destruction, Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less known quarters, where a guard of police should watch over them. It was an empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim old colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of Iron Dike. \u201cLeave him to me,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cHe\u2019s my man, and I\u2019ll get him sure if I have to wait a year for him.\u201d A vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge, and so for the time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job. Such were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the deeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence.

Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature bound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror. Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875.", "chapter": "V\nThe Darkest Hour"}
{"text": "Chapter VI Danger It was the height of the reign of terror. McMurdo, who had already been appointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. The more popular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. In spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors. Rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people. But McGinty and his men were undisturbed by such reports. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their opponents were scattered and powerless. It would all end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests. So said McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits. It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care, and his kindly face was drawn and haggard. \u201cCan I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.\u201d \u201cWhat else could I do if you trusted me? It wasn\u2019t that I agreed with what you said.\u201d \u201cI know that well. But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe. I\u2019ve a secret here,\u201d he put his hand to his breast, \u201cand it is just burning the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one of you but me. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. If I don\u2019t, it may bring the end of us all. God help me, but I am near out of my wits over it!\u201d McMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was trembling in every limb. He poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him. \u201cThat\u2019s the physic for the likes of you,\u201d said he. \u201cNow let me hear of it.\u201d Morris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. \u201cI can tell it to you all in one sentence,\u201d said he. \u201cThere\u2019s a detective on our trail.\u201d McMurdo stared at him in astonishment. \u201cWhy, man, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us?\u201d \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s no man of the district. As you say, we know them, and it is little that they can do. But you\u2019ve heard of Pinkerton\u2019s?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve read of some folk of that name.\u201d \u201cWell, you can take it from me you\u2019ve no show when they are on your trail.

If a Pinkerton man is deep in this business, we are all destroyed.\u201d \u201cWe must kill him.\u201d \u201cAh, it\u2019s the first thought that came to you! So it will be up at the lodge. Didn\u2019t I say to you that it would end in murder?\u201d \u201cSure, what is murder? Isn\u2019t it common enough in these parts?\u201d \u201cIt is, indeed; but it\u2019s not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered. I\u2019d never rest easy again. And yet it\u2019s our own necks that may be at stake. In God\u2019s name what shall I do?\u201d He rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision. But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It was easy to see that he shared the other\u2019s opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting it. He gripped Morris\u2019s shoulder and shook him in his earnestness. \u201cSee here, man,\u201d he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his excitement, \u201cyou won\u2019t gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake. Let\u2019s have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he? How did you hear of him? Why did you come to me?\u201d \u201cI came to you; for you are the one man that would advise me. I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here. I left good friends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. Here\u2019s a letter that I had from him yesterday. It\u2019s this part from the top of the page. You can read it yourself.\u201d This was what McMurdo read: How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? We read plenty of them in the papers. Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before long. Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest. They mean it, and you can bet they\u2019ll get there! They are right deep down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold under their orders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is operating. The thing has got to be stopped right now. \u201cNow read the postscript.\u201d Of course, what I give you is what I learned in business; so it goes no further. It\u2019s a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from. McMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the letter in his listless hands. The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before him. \u201cDoes anyone else know of this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have told no one", "chapter": "VI\nDanger"}

But I should not think he knew him. He is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business. How would he know this Pinkerton man?\u201d McMurdo gave a violent start. \u201cBy Gar!\u201d he cried, \u201cI\u2019ve got him. What a fool I was not to know it. Lord! but we\u2019re in luck! We will fix him before he can do any harm. See here, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?\u201d \u201cSure, if you will only take it off mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do that. You can stand right back and let me run it. Even your name need not be mentioned. I\u2019ll take it all on myself, as if it were to me that this letter has come.

Now I\u2019ll get down to the lodge, and we\u2019ll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill this man?\u201d \u201cThe less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be, and the better you will sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things settle themselves. I have hold of it now.\u201d Morris shook his head sadly as he left. \u201cI feel that his blood is on my hands,\u201d he groaned. \u201cSelf-protection is no murder, anyhow,\u201d said McMurdo, smiling grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we\u2019ll have to elect you Bodymaster yet; for you\u2019ve surely saved the lodge.\u201d And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his guilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton organization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers; but, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst.

The house was forbidden him; but when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish deviltry had gone from her lover\u2019s eyes. She read his danger in his earnest face. \u201cSomething has happened!\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, Jack, you are in danger!\u201d \u201cSure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse.\u201d \u201cMake a move?\u201d \u201cI promised you once that I would go some day. I think the time is coming.

But, sure, you wouldn\u2019t know what that is, acushla, nor what it may mean to the likes of me. I\u2019m too deep in this thing, and I may have to get out of it quick.

I wouldn\u2019t hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you. Would you trust me?\u201d She put her hand in his without a word. \u201cWell, then, listen to what I say, and do as I order you, for indeed it\u2019s the only way for us. Things are going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I\u2019m one, anyhow.

It had already assembled, and only by complicated signs and countersigns could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered. The long room was crowded, and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face of Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news. \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s glad we are to see you, Brother!\u201d cried the chairman. \u201cThere\u2019s business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Lander and Egan,\u201d explained his neighbour as he took his seat. \u201cThey both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who\u2019s to say which fired the bullet?\u201d McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of expectation. \u201cEminent Bodymaster,\u201d he said, in a solemn voice, \u201cI claim urgency!\u201d \u201cBrother McMurdo claims urgency,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cIt\u2019s a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you.\u201d McMurdo took the letter from his pocket. \u201cEminent Bodymaster and Brethren,\u201d he said, \u201cI am the bearer of ill news this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed, than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all. I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into a felon\u2019s cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.\u201d There was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman. \u201cWhat is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is in this letter which has come into my hands,\u201d said McMurdo.

He\u2019s a brave man, but not a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson\u2019s Patch.\u201d \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \u201cBecause I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the time, nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the man. I met him on the cars when I went down the line on Wednesday\u2014a hard case if ever there was one. He said he was a reporter. I believed it for the moment. Wanted to know all he could about the Scowrers and what he called \u2018the outrages\u2019 for a New York paper. Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. You bet I was giving nothing away. \u2018I\u2019d pay for it and pay well,\u2019 said he, \u2018if I could get some stuff that would suit my editor.\u2019 I said what I thought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my information. \u2018There\u2019s ten times that for you,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you can find me all that I want.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat did you tell him, then?\u201d \u201cAny stuff I could make up.\u201d \u201cHow do you know he wasn\u2019t a newspaper man?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you. He got out at Hobson\u2019s Patch, and so did I. I chanced into the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it. \u201c\u2018See here,\u2019 said the operator after he\u2019d gone out, \u2018I guess we should charge double rates for this.\u2019\u2014\u2018I guess you should,\u2019 said I. He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we could make of it. \u2018He fires a sheet of this off every day,\u2019 said the clerk. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said I; \u2018it\u2019s special news for his paper, and he\u2019s scared that the others should tap it.\u2019 That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I think differently now.\u201d \u201cBy Gar! I believe you are right,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cBut what do you allow that we should do about it?\u201d \u201cWhy not go right down now and fix him?\u201d someone suggested. \u201cAy, the sooner the better.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cHe\u2019s in Hobson\u2019s Patch; but I don\u2019t know the", "chapter": "VI\nDanger"}

Let him come at ten o\u2019clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch him sure.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cYou can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara\u2019s is a lonely house. She\u2019s as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There\u2019s only Scanlan and me in the house.

{"text": "Chapter VII The Trapping of Birdy Edwards As McMurdo had said, the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned. It was on the extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road. In any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man, as they had many a time before, and emptied their pistols into his body; but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew, how he knew it, and what had been passed on to his employers. It was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done. If that was indeed so, they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it. But they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detective\u2019s knowledge, as otherwise, they argued, he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him. However, all this they would learn from his own lips. Once in their power, they would find a way to make him speak. It was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness. McMurdo went to Hobson\u2019s Patch as agreed. The police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin\u2014he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago\u2014actually addressed him as he waited at the station. McMurdo turned away and refused to speak with him. He was back from his mission in the afternoon, and saw McGinty at the Union House. \u201cHe is coming,\u201d he said. \u201cGood!\u201d said McGinty. The giant was in his shirt sleeves, with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard. Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. The more terrible, therefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before. \u201cDo you reckon he knows much?\u201d he asked anxiously. McMurdo shook his head gloomily. \u201cHe\u2019s been here some time\u2014six weeks at the least. I guess he didn\u2019t come into these parts to look at the prospect. If he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back, I should expect that he has got results, and that he has passed them on.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a weak man in the lodge,\u201d cried McGinty. \u201cTrue as steel, every man of them. And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris. What about him? If any man gives us away, it would be he. I\u2019ve a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him.\u201d \u201cWell, there would be no harm in that,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cI won\u2019t deny that I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him", "chapter": "VII\nThe Trapping of Birdy Edwards"}

He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters, and though he may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that squeals. But still it is not for me to stand between him and you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll fix the old devil!\u201d said McGinty with an oath. \u201cI\u2019ve had my eye on him this year past.\u201d \u201cWell, you know best about that,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cBut whatever you do must be to-morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is settled up. We can\u2019t afford to set the police buzzing, to-day of all days.\u201d \u201cTrue for you,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll learn from Birdy Edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first. Did he seem to scent a trap?\u201d McMurdo laughed. \u201cI guess I took him on his weak point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he\u2019s ready to follow it into hell. I took his money,\u201d McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes, \u201cand as much more when he has seen all my papers.\u201d \u201cWhat papers?\u201d \u201cWell, there are no papers. But I filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership. He expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves.\u201d \u201cFaith, he\u2019s right there,\u201d said McGinty grimly. \u201cDidn\u2019t he ask you why you didn\u2019t bring him the papers?\u201d \u201cAs if I would carry such things, and me a suspected man, and Captain Marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot!\u201d \u201cAy, I heard of that,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cI guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you. We could put him down an old shaft when we\u2019ve done with him; but however we work it we can\u2019t get past the man living at Hobson\u2019s Patch and you being there to-day.\u201d McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIf we handle it right, they can never prove the killing,\u201d said he. \u201cNo one can see him come to the house after dark, and I\u2019ll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see here, Councillor, I\u2019ll show you my plan and I\u2019ll ask you to fit the others into it. You will all come in good time. Very well. He comes at ten. He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. Then I\u2019ll get behind him and shut it. He\u2019s our man then.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all easy and plain.\u201d \u201cYes; but the next step wants considering. He\u2019s a hard proposition. He\u2019s heavily armed.

Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. As he is reading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm. You\u2019ll hear me call and in you will rush. The quicker the better; for he is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. But I allow that I can hold him till you come.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good plan,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cThe lodge will owe you a debt for this. I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man that\u2019s coming after me.\u201d \u201cSure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,\u201d said McMurdo; but his face showed what he thought of the great man\u2019s compliment. When he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim evening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith & Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was to be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the centre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were windows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which drew across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have struck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he discussed the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly what was intended. \u201cAnd if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep clear of it. There will be", "chapter": "VII\nThe Trapping of Birdy Edwards"}

There will be bloody work here before morning.\u201d \u201cWell, indeed then, Mac,\u201d Scanlan answered. \u201cIt\u2019s not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. I\u2019m not made for it, same as you or McGinty. If the lodge will think none the worse of me, I\u2019ll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the evening.\u201d The men came in good time as arranged. They were outwardly respectable citizens, well clad and cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read little hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless eyes. There was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen times before. They were as hardened to human murder as a butcher to sheep. Foremost, of course, both in appearance and in guilt, was the formidable Boss. Harraway, the secretary, was a lean, bitter man with a long, scraggy neck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finances of the order were concerned, and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter, was a middle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky expression, and a yellow parchment skin. He was a capable organizer, and the actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. The two Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe young fellows with determined faces, while their companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark youth, was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition. These were the men who assembled that night under the roof of McMurdo for the killing of the Pinkerton detective. Their host had placed whisky upon the table, and they had hastened to prime themselves for the work before them. Baldwin and Cormac were already half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity. Cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant\u2014it had been lighted, for the nights were still cold. \u201cThat will do,\u201d said he, with an oath. \u201cAy,\u201d said Baldwin, catching his meaning. \u201cIf he is strapped to that, we will have the truth out of him.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have the truth out of him, never fear,\u201d said McMurdo. He had nerves of steel, this man; for though the whole weight of the affair was on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever. The others marked it and applauded. \u201cYou are the one to handle him,\u201d said the Boss approvingly. \u201cNot a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat.

It\u2019s a pity there are no shutters to your windows.\u201d McMurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter. \u201cSure no one can spy upon us now. It\u2019s close upon the hour.\u201d \u201cMaybe he won\u2019t come. Maybe he\u2019ll get a sniff of danger,\u201d said the secretary. \u201cHe\u2019ll come, never fear,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cHe is as eager to come as you can be to see him. Hark to that!\u201d They all sat like wax figures, some with their glasses arrested halfway to their lips. Three loud knocks had sounded at the door. \u201cHush!\u201d McMurdo raised his hand in caution. An exulting glance went round the circle, and hands were laid upon their weapons. \u201cNot a sound, for your lives!\u201d McMurdo whispered, as he went from the room, closing the door carefully behind him. [Illustration: \u201cNot a sound, for your lives!\u201d McMurdo whispered.] With strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of their comrade down the passage. Then they heard him open the outer door. There were a few words as of greeting. Then they were aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice. An instant later came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey was safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his great hand across his mouth. \u201cBe quiet, you fool!\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the undoing of us yet!\u201d There was a mutter of conversation from the next room. It seemed interminable. Then the door opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger upon his lip. He came to the end of the table and looked round at them. A subtle change had come over him. His manner was as of one who has great work to do. His face had set into granite firmness. His eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles. He had become a visible leader of men. They stared at him with eager interest; but he said nothing. Still with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man. \u201cWell!\u201d cried Boss McGinty at last. \u201cIs he here? Is Birdy Edwards here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d McMurdo answered slowly. \u201cBirdy Edwards is here. I am Birdy Edwards!\u201d There were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room might have been empty, so profound was the silence. The hissing of a kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. Seven white faces, all turned upward to this man who dominated them, were set motionless with utter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window, while the curtains were torn from their hangings.

Seven white faces, all turned upward to this man who dominated them, were set motionless with utter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window, while the curtains were torn from their hangings. At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged for the half-opened door. A levelled revolver met him there with the stern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Police gleaming behind the sights. The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re safer there, Councillor,\u201d said the man whom they had known as McMurdo. \u201cAnd you, Baldwin, if you don\u2019t take your hand off your pistol, you\u2019ll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that made me\u2014There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house, and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have. Take their pistols, Marvin!\u201d There was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. The men were disarmed. Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round the table. \u201cI\u2019d like to say a word to you before we separate,\u201d said the man who had trapped them. \u201cI guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse. I\u2019ll give you something to think over between now and then. You know me now for what I am. At last I can put my cards on the table. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton\u2019s. I was chosen to break up your gang. I had a hard and dangerous game to play. Not a soul, not one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I was playing it. Only Captain Marvin here and my employers knew that. But it\u2019s over to-night, thank God, and I am the winner!\u201d The seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him. There was unappeasable hatred in their eyes. He read the relentless threat. \u201cMaybe you think that the game is not over yet. Well, I take my chance of that. Anyhow, some of you will take no further hand, and there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night. I\u2019ll tell you this, that when I was put upon this job I never believed there was such a society as yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I would prove it so. They told me it was to do with the Freemen; so I went to Chicago and was made one. Then I was surer than ever that it was just paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but a deal of good. \u201cStill, I had to carry out my job, and I came to the coal valleys.

When I reached this place I learned that I was wrong and that it wasn\u2019t a dime novel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never killed a man in Chicago. I never minted a dollar in my life. Those I gave you were as good as any others; but I never spent money better. But I knew the way into your good wishes and so I pretended to you that the law was after me. It all worked just as I thought. \u201cSo I joined your infernal lodge, and I took my share in your councils. Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they like, so long as I get you. But what is the truth? The night I joined you beat up old man Stanger. I could not warn him, for there was no time; but I held your hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. If ever I have suggested things, so as to keep my place among you, they were things which I knew I could prevent. I could not save Dunn and Menzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see that their murderers are hanged. I gave Chester Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding. There was many a crime that I could not stop; but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road, or was down in town when you went for him, or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out, you\u2019ll see my work.\u201d \u201cYou blasted traitor!\u201d hissed McGinty through his closed teeth. \u201cAy, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. You and your like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip. There was just one way of doing it, and I did it. You call me a traitor; but I guess there\u2019s many a thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save them. I\u2019ve had three months of it. I wouldn\u2019t have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at Washington for it. I had to stay till I had it all, every man and every secret right here in this hand. I\u2019d have waited a little longer if it hadn\u2019t come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out. A letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all.

Now, Marvin, I\u2019ll keep you no more. Take them in and get it over.\u201d There is little more to tell. Scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift, unbroken journey out of the land of danger. It was the last time that ever either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days later they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as witness of the wedding. The trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law. In vain they struggled. In vain the money of the lodge\u2014money squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countryside\u2014was spent like water in the attempt to save them. That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives, their organization, and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders. At last after so many years they were broken and scattered. The cloud was lifted forever from the valley. McGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cringing and whining when the last hour came. Eight of his chief followers shared his fate. Fifty-odd had various degrees of imprisonment. The work of Birdy Edwards was complete. And yet, as he had guessed, the game was not over yet. There was another hand to be played, and yet another and another. Ted Baldwin, for one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Willabys; so had several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang. For ten years they were out of the world, and then came a day when they were free once more\u2014a day which Edwards, who knew his men, was very sure would be an end of his life of peace. They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades. And well they strove to keep their vow! From Chicago he was chased, after two attempts so near success that it was sure that the third would get him.

From Chicago he went under a changed name to California, and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly killed, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely canyon, where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a fortune. At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more, and he cleared\u2014only just in time\u2014for England. And thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate, and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard. Epilogue The police trial had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was referred to a higher court. So had the Quarter Sessions, at which he was acquitted as having acted in self-defense. \u201cGet him out of England at any cost,\u201d wrote Holmes to the wife. \u201cThere are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped. There is no safety for your husband in England.\u201d Two months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our minds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box. \u201cDear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!\u201d said this singular epistle. There was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint message; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness. \u201cDeviltry, Watson!\u201d he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow. Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see Mr. Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and haggard. \u201cI\u2019ve had bad news\u2014terrible news, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he. \u201cI feared as much,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou have not had a cable, have you?\u201d \u201cI have had a note from someone who has.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s poor Douglas. They tell me his name is Edwards; but he will always be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me. I told you that they started together for South Africa in the Palmyra three weeks ago.\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cThe ship reached Cape Town last night. I received this cable from Mrs. Douglas this morning: \u201cJack has been lost overboard in gale off St. Helena. No one knows how accident occurred. \u201cIVY DOUGLAS.\u201d \u201cHa! It came like that, did it?\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve no doubt it was well stage-managed.\u201d \u201cYou mean that you think there was no accident?\u201d \u201cNone in the world.\u201d \u201cHe was murdered?\u201d \u201cSurely!\u201d \u201cSo I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive nest of criminals\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, my good sir,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThere is a master hand here.

It is no case of sawed-off shotguns and clumsy six-shooters. You can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Moriarty when I see one. This crime is from London, not from America.\u201d \u201cBut for what motive?\u201d \u201cBecause it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail, one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. A great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man. It is crushing the nut with the triphammer\u2014an absurd extravagance of energy\u2014but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same.\u201d \u201cHow came this man to have anything to do with it?\u201d \u201cI can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants. These Americans were well advised. Having an English job to do, they took into partnership, as any foreign criminal could do, this great consultant in crime. From that moment their man was doomed. At first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim. Then he would indicate how the matter might be treated. Finally, when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent, he would step in himself with a master touch. You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that the coming danger was greater than the past. Was I right?\u201d Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger. \u201cDo not tell me that we have to sit down under this? Do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t say that,\u201d said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future. \u201cI don\u2019t say that he can\u2019t be beat. But you must give me time\u2014you must give me time!\u201d We all sat in silence for some minutes while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil.", "chapter": "VII\nThe Trapping of Birdy Edwards"}
