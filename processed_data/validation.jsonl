I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.\u201d \u201cI have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?\u201d I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back. \u201cThere are hardly any data,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThe watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\u201d \u201cYou are right,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was cleaned before being sent to me.\u201d In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch? \u201cThough unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\u201d he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. \u201cSubject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\u201d \u201cThat you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\u201d \u201cQuite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\u201d \u201cRight, so far,\u201d said I. \u201cAnything else?\u201d \u201cHe was a man of untidy habits,\u2014very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.\u201d I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart. \u201cThis is unworthy of you, Holmes,\u201d I said. \u201cI could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way.

You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\u201d \u201cMy dear doctor,\u201d said he, kindly, \u201cpray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\u201d \u201cThen how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.\u201d \u201cAh, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\u201d \u201cBut it was not mere guess-work?\u201d \u201cNo, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,\u2014destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.\u201d I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning. \u201cIt is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference,\u2014that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference,\u2014that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole,\u2014marks where the key has slipped. What sober man\u2019s key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard\u2019s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?\u201d \u201cIt is as clear as daylight,\u201d I answered. \u201cI regret the injustice which I did you.", "chapter": "I\nThe Science of Deduction"}

Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.\u201d I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver. \u201cA young lady for you, sir,\u201d she said, addressing my companion. \u201cMiss Mary Morstan,\u201d he read. \u201cHum!

{"text": "Chapter II The Statement of the Case Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre greyish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation. \u201cI have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\u201d \u201cMrs. Cecil Forrester,\u201d he repeated thoughtfully. \u201cI believe that I was of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one.\u201d \u201cShe did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself.\u201d Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut, hawklike features. \u201cState your case,\u201d said he, in brisk, business tones. I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. \u201cYou will, I am sure, excuse me,\u201d I said, rising from my chair. To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me. \u201cIf your friend,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.\u201d I relapsed into my chair. \u201cBriefly,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe facts are these. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve months\u2019 leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love.

His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father.

There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,\u2014some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there.\u201d \u201cHad he any friends in town?\u201d \u201cOnly one that we know of,\u2014Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England.\u201d \u201cA singular case,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cI have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six years ago\u2014to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882\u2014an advertisement appeared in the _Times_ asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was no name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column. The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome.\u201d She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen. \u201cYour statement is most interesting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cHas anything else occurred to you?\u201d \u201cYes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe envelope", "chapter": "II\nThe Statement of the Case"}

No address. \u2018Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o\u2019clock. If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.\u2019 Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\u201d \u201cThat is exactly what I want to ask you.\u201d \u201cThen we shall most certainly go. You and I and\u2014yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before.\u201d \u201cBut would he come?\u201d she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression. \u201cI should be proud and happy,\u201d said I, fervently, \u201cif I can be of any service.\u201d \u201cYou are both very kind,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?\u201d \u201cYou must not be later,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThere is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?\u201d \u201cI have them here,\u201d she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper. \u201cYou are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now.\u201d He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little darting glances from one to the other. \u201cThey are disguised hands, except the letter,\u201d he said, presently, \u201cbut there can be no question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek _e_ will break out, and see the twirl of the final _s_. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\u201d \u201cNothing could be more unlike.\u201d \u201cI expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. _Au revoir_, then.\u201d \u201c_Au revoir_,\u201d said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the grey turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd. \u201cWhat a very attractive woman!\u201d I exclaimed, turning to my companion.

A client is to me a mere unit,\u2014a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\u201d \u201cIn this case, however\u2014\u201d \u201cI never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow\u2019s scribble?\u201d \u201cIt is legible and regular,\u201d I answered. \u201cA man of business habits and some force of character.\u201d Holmes shook his head. \u201cLook at his long letters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hardly rise above the common herd. That _d_ might be an _a_, and that _l_ an _e_. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his _k_\u2019s and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,\u2014one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade\u2019s \u2018Martyrdom of Man.\u2019 I shall be back in an hour.\u201d I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor,\u2014her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of her father\u2019s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,\u2014a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,\u2014nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o\u2019-the-wisps of the imagination.", "chapter": "II\nThe Statement of the Case"}
{"text": "Chapter III In Quest of a Solution It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,\u2014a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression. \u201cThere is no great mystery in this matter,\u201d he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him. \u201cThe facts appear to admit of only one explanation.\u201d \u201cWhat! you have solved it already?\u201d \u201cWell, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, _very_ suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the _Times_, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norwood, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\u201d \u201cI may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\u201d \u201cNo? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. _Within a week of his death_ Captain Morstan\u2019s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto\u2019s death, unless it is that Sholto\u2019s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?\u201d \u201cBut what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.\u201d \u201cThere are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \u201cBut our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.\u201d I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought that our night\u2019s work might be a serious one. Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her. \u201cMajor Sholto was a very particular friend of papa\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHis letters were full of allusions to the major.

I don\u2019t suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.\u201d Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens. \u201cIt is paper of native Indian manufacture,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is \u20183.37 from left,\u2019 in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, \u2018The sign of the four,\u2014Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.\u2019 No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter.

It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\u201d \u201cIt was in his pocket-book that we found it.\u201d \u201cPreserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.\u201d He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey. It was a September evening, and not yet seven o\u2019clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,\u2014sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.

Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan\u2019s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern. At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us. \u201cAre you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\u201d said she. He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. \u201cYou will excuse me, miss,\u201d he said with a certain dogged manner, \u201cbut I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.\u201d \u201cI give you my word on that,\u201d she answered. He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets. The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,\u2014which was an inconceivable hypothesis,\u2014or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan\u2019s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way.

Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.\u201d We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side. \u201cWordsworth Road,\u201d said my companion. \u201cPriory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\u201d We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,\u2014the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house. \u201cThe Sahib awaits you,\u201d said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. \u201cShow them in to me, khitmutgar,\u201d it cried. \u201cShow them straight in to me.\u201d", "chapter": "III\nIn Quest of a Solution"}
{"text": "Chapter IV The Story of the Bald-Headed Man We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year. \u201cYour servant, Miss Morstan,\u201d he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice. \u201cYour servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London.\u201d We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour. \u201cMr. Thaddeus Sholto,\u201d said the little man, still jerking and smiling. \u201cThat is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen\u2014\u201d \u201cThis is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\u201d \u201cA doctor, eh?\u201d cried he, much excited. \u201cHave you your stethoscope? Might I ask you\u2014would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\u201d I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. \u201cIt appears to be normal,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have no cause for uneasiness.\u201d \u201cYou will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\u201d he remarked, airily. \u201cI am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that", "chapter": "IV\nThe Story of the Bald-Headed Man"}

Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.\u201d I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips. \u201cI knew in my heart that he was dead,\u201d said she. \u201cI can give you every information,\u201d said he, \u201cand, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,\u2014no police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\u201d He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes. \u201cFor my part,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cwhatever you may choose to say will go no further.\u201d I nodded to show my agreement. \u201cThat is well! That is well!\u201d said he. \u201cMay I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\u201d He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semi-circle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre. \u201cWhen I first determined to make this communication to you,\u201d said he, \u201cI might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter.

The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school.\u201d \u201cYou will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\u201d said Miss Morstan, \u201cbut I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.\u201d \u201cAt the best it must take some time,\u201d he answered; \u201cfor we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me. I had quite high words with him last night. You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry.\u201d \u201cIf we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once,\u201d I ventured to remark. He laughed until his ears were quite red. \u201cThat would hardly do,\u201d he cried. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself. \u201cMy father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children. \u201cI very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers, and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father\u2019s, we discussed the case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened.

He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,\u2014that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan. \u201cWe did know, however, that some mystery\u2014some positive danger\u2014overhung our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father\u2019s, but events have since led us to change our opinion. \u201cEarly in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us. \u201cWhen we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall try and give it to you in his own very words. \u201c\u2018I have only one thing,\u2019 he said, \u2018which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan\u2019s orphan. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself,\u2014so blind and foolish a thing is avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send her nothing\u2014not even the chaplet\u2014until I am gone. After all, men", "chapter": "IV\nThe Story of the Bald-Headed Man"}

But send her nothing\u2014not even the chaplet\u2014until I am gone. After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered. \u201c\u2018I will tell you how Morstan died,\u2019 he continued. \u2018He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan\u2019s arrival he came straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is now dead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead. \u201c\u2018For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know. \u201c\u2018I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the door behind him. \u201cDo not fear, Sahib,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one need know that you have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\u201d \u201cI did not kill him,\u201d said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. \u201cI heard it all, Sahib,\u201d said he. \u201cI heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away together.\u201d That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.

My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan\u2019s share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in\u2014\u2019 \u201cAt this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, \u2018Keep him out! For Christ\u2019s sake keep him out!\u2019 We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat. \u201cWe searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father\u2019s room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words \u2018The sign of the four\u2019 scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of my father\u2019s property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us.\u201d The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father\u2019s death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table.

She rallied however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe. \u201cMy brother and I,\u201d said he, \u201cwere, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father\u2019s fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan\u2019s address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.\u201d \u201cIt was a kindly thought,\u201d said our companion, earnestly. \u201cIt was extremely good of you.\u201d The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. \u201cWe were your trustees,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the view which I took of it, though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. \u2018Le mauvais go\u00fbt m\u00e8ne au crime.\u2019 The French have a very neat way of putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share.

I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\u201d Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee. We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to spring to his feet. \u201cYou have done well, sir, from first to last,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.\u201d Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face. \u201cMy health is somewhat fragile,\u201d he remarked, as he led the way down the passage. \u201cI am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\u201d Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace. Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels. \u201cBartholomew is a clever fellow,\u201d said he. \u201cHow do you think he found out where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.\u201d At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news;", "chapter": "IV\nThe Story of the Bald-Headed Man"}

Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door. \u201cThis, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\u201d said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.", "chapter": "IV\nThe Story of the Bald-Headed Man"}
{"text": "Chapter V The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge It was nearly eleven o\u2019clock when we reached this final stage of our night\u2019s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way. Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat. \u201cWho is there?\u201d cried a gruff voice from within. \u201cIt is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.\u201d There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes. \u201cThat you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about them from the master.\u201d \u201cNo, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.\u201d \u201cHe ain\u2019t been out o\u2019 his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\u201d This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner. \u201cThis is too bad of you, McMurdo!\u201d he said. \u201cIf I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\u201d \u201cVery sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\u201d said the porter, inexorably. \u201cFolk may be friends o\u2019 yours, and yet no friends o\u2019 the master\u2019s. He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I\u2019ll do. I don\u2019t know none o\u2019 your friends.\u201d \u201cOh, yes you do, McMurdo,\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have forgotten me.

You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.\u201d \u201cYou see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cOur friend won\u2019t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\u201d \u201cIn you come, sir, in you come,\u2014you and your friends,\u201d he answered. \u201cVery sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.\u201d Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand. \u201cI cannot understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it.\u201d \u201cDoes he always guard the premises in this way?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cYes; he has followed my father\u2019s custom. He was the favourite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew\u2019s window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.\u201d \u201cNone,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBut I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.\u201d \u201cAh, that is the housekeeper\u2019s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\u201d He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds,\u2014the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman. \u201cIt is Mrs. Bernstone,\u201d said Sholto. \u201cShe is the only woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.\u201d He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him. \u201cOh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\u201d We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone. Our guide had left us the lantern.

I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\u201d We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone. Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us. \u201cWhat a strange place!\u201d she said, looking round. \u201cIt looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work.\u201d \u201cAnd from the same cause,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThese are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\u201d At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes. \u201cThere is something amiss with Bartholomew!\u201d he cried. \u201cI am frightened! My nerves cannot stand it.\u201d He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child. \u201cCome into the house,\u201d said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way. \u201cYes, do!\u201d pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. \u201cI really do not feel equal to giving directions.\u201d We all followed him into the housekeeper\u2019s room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her. \u201cGod bless your sweet calm face!\u201d she cried, with an hysterical sob. \u201cIt does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!\u201d Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the other\u2019s bloodless cheeks. \u201cMaster has locked himself in and will not answer me,\u201d she explained. \u201cAll day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so", "chapter": "V\nThe Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge"}

You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,\u2014you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face on him as that.\u201d Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto\u2019s teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper. The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath. \u201cThere is something devilish in this, Watson,\u201d said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,\u2014the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion.

So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins. \u201cThis is terrible!\u201d I said to Holmes. \u201cWhat is to be done?\u201d \u201cThe door must come down,\u201d he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto\u2019s chamber. It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together. By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument,\u2014a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows. In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \u201cThe sign of the four.\u201d \u201cIn God\u2019s name, what does it all mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt means murder,\u201d said he, stooping over the dead man. \u201cAh, I expected it. Look here!\u201d He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear. \u201cIt looks like a thorn,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is a thorn. You may pick it out.

But be careful, for it is poisoned.\u201d I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been. \u201cThis is all an insoluble mystery to me,\u201d said I. \u201cIt grows darker instead of clearer.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he answered, \u201cit clears every instant. I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\u201d We had almost forgotten our companion\u2019s presence since we entered the chamber. He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry. \u201cThe treasure is gone!\u201d he said. \u201cThey have robbed him of the treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came downstairs.\u201d \u201cWhat time was that?\u201d \u201cIt was ten o\u2019clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don\u2019t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don\u2019t think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!\u201d He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy. \u201cYou have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\u201d said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder. \u201cTake my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way.

{"text": "Chapter VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration \u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \u201cwe have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.\u201d \u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cSurely,\u201d said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class. \u201cJust sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?\u201d He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. \u201cWindow is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration.\u201d I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. \u201cThis is not a footmark,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.\u201d \u201cIt is the wooden-legged man.\u201d \u201cQuite so. But there has been some one else,\u2014a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?\u201d I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work. \u201cIt is absolutely impossible,\u201d I answered. \u201cWithout aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted,\u201d he continued, fingering the rope, \u201cthat our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny.

My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.\u201d \u201cThis is all very well,\u201d said I, \u201cbut the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he into the room?\u201d \u201cYes, the ally!\u201d repeated Holmes, pensively. \u201cThere are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country,\u2014though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\u201d \u201cHow came he, then?\u201d I reiterated. \u201cThe door is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?\u201d \u201cThe grate is much too small,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had already considered that possibility.\u201d \u201cHow then?\u201d I persisted. \u201cYou will not apply my precept,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cHow often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, _however improbable_, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\u201d \u201cHe came through the hole in the roof,\u201d I cried. \u201cOf course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above,\u2014the secret room in which the treasure was found.\u201d He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him. The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor. \u201cHere you are, you see,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall. \u201cThis is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered.

Let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality.\u201d He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face. For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,\u2014clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man. \u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, in a whisper, \u201ca child has done the horrid thing.\u201d He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. \u201cI was staggered for the moment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the thing is quite natural. My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down.\u201d \u201cWhat is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\u201d I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more. \u201cMy dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\u201d said he, with a touch of impatience. \u201cYou know my methods. Apply them, and it will be instructive to compare results.\u201d \u201cI cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt will be clear enough to you soon,\u201d he said, in an off-hand way. \u201cI think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\u201d He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight. \u201cWe are certainly in luck,\u201d said he. \u201cWe ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You see, and the stuff has leaked out.\u201d \u201cWhat then?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy, we have got him, that\u2019s all,\u201d said he. \u201cI know a dog that would follow that scent to the world\u2019s end.

What do you feel?\u201d \u201cThe muscles are as hard as a board,\u201d I answered. \u201cQuite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual _rigor mortis_. Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or \u2018_risus sardonicus_,\u2019 as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\u201d \u201cDeath from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\u201d I answered,\u2014\u201csome strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\u201d \u201cThat was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now examine the thorn.\u201d I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife. \u201cIs that an English thorn?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, it certainly is not.\u201d \u201cWith all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\u201d As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a grey suit strode heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto. \u201cHere\u2019s a business!\u201d he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. \u201cHere\u2019s a pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!\u201d \u201cI think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\u201d said Holmes, quietly. \u201cWhy, of course I do!\u201d he wheezed. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist.

Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,\u2014no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case!

Still, we can\u2019t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?\u201d \u201cFastened; but there are steps on the sill.\u201d \u201cWell, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That\u2019s common sense.

Your friend can remain.\u2014What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cOn which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.\u201d \u201cHum! There\u2019s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.

No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance is\u2014well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.\u201d \u201cYou are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man\u2019s scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?\u201d \u201cConfirms it in every respect,\u201d said the fat detective, pompously. \u201cHouse is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,\u2014a blind, as like as not.

Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.\u201d With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door. \u201cHe can find something,\u201d remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cHe has occasional glimmerings of reason. _Il n\u2019y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l\u2019esprit!_\u201d \u201cYou see!\u201d said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again. \u201cFacts are better than mere theories, after all.

I arrest you in the Queen\u2019s name as being concerned in the death of your brother.\u201d \u201cThere, now! Didn\u2019t I tell you!\u201d cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us. \u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,\u2014don\u2019t promise too much!\u201d snapped the detective. \u201cYou may find it a harder matter than you think.\u201d \u201cNot only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man\u2014\u201d \u201cAh! the other man\u2014?\u201d asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other\u2019s manner. \u201cIs a rather curious person,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel. \u201cI hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them.\u2014A word with you, Watson.\u201d He led me out to the head of the stair. \u201cThis unexpected occurrence,\u201d he", "chapter": "VI\nSherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration"}

She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?\u201d \u201cBy no means. I don\u2019t think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely.

When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3, Pinchin Lane, down near the water\u2019s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer\u2019s: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window.

You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.\u201d \u201cA dog, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYes,\u2014a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent.

{"text": "Chapter VII The Episode of the Barrel The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,\u2014so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes\u2019s researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was it fair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us. It was nearly two o\u2019clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester\u2019s. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other\u2019s waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an honoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.

It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us. And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,\u2014we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan\u2019s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto\u2019s death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan\u2019s chart,\u2014here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue. Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window. \u201cGo on, you drunken vagabone,\u201d said the face. \u201cIf you kick up any more row I\u2019ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019ll let one out it\u2019s just what I have come for,\u201d said I. \u201cGo on!\u201d yelled the voice. \u201cSo help me gracious, I have a wiper in the bag, an\u2019 I\u2019ll drop it on your \u2019ead if you don\u2019t hook it.\u201d \u201cBut I want a dog,\u201d I cried. \u201cI won\u2019t be argued with!\u201d shouted Mr. Sherman. \u201cNow stand clear, for when I say \u2018three,\u2019 down goes the wiper.\u201d \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes\u2014\u201d I began, but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses. \u201cA friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\u201d said he. \u201cStep in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?\u201d This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. \u201cDon\u2019t mind that, sir: it\u2019s only a slow-worm.

What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\u201d \u201cHe wanted a dog of yours.\u201d \u201cAh! that would be Toby.\u201d \u201cYes, Toby was the name.\u201d \u201cToby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\u201d He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers. Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsy waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective\u2019s name. Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe. \u201cAh, you have him there!\u201d said he. \u201cGood dog, then! Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant upstairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\u201d We tied Toby to the hall table, and re-ascended the stairs. The room was as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner. \u201cLend me your bull\u2019s-eye, sergeant,\u201d said my companion. \u201cNow tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.\u2014Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment.\u201d We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust. \u201cI wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you observe anything noteworthy about them?\u201d \u201cThey belong,\u201d I said, \u201cto a child or a small woman.\u201d \u201cApart from their size, though.

Is there nothing else?\u201d \u201cThey appear to be much as other footmarks.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?\u201d \u201cYour toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe distinctly divided.\u201d \u201cQuite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\u201d I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell. \u201cThat is where he put his foot in getting out. If _you_ can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run downstairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\u201d By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves. \u201cThat you, Watson?\u201d he cried. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThis is the place. What is that black thing down there?\u201d \u201cA water-barrel.\u201d \u201cTop on it?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNo sign of a ladder?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cConfound the fellow! It\u2019s a most break-neck place. I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm. Here goes, anyhow.\u201d There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth. \u201cIt was easy to follow him,\u201d he said, drawing on his stockings and boots. \u201cTiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\u201d The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto. \u201cThey are hellish things,\u201d said he. \u201cLook out that you don\u2019t prick yourself.

I\u2019m delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered. \u201cYour leg will stand it?\u201d \u201cOh, yes.\u201d \u201cHere you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!\u201d He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog\u2019s nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel\u2019s collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed. The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold grey light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it. On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side. \u201cThere\u2019s the print of wooden-leg\u2019s hand,\u201d he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. \u201cYou see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours\u2019 start.\u201d I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents. \u201cDo not imagine,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}

I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.\u201d \u201cThere is credit, and to spare,\u201d said I. \u201cI assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?\u201d \u201cPshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don\u2019t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan\u2019s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates,\u2014the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers\u2014or one of them\u2014gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.\u201d \u201cBut that is mere speculation,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?\u201d \u201cA letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\u201d \u201cOr had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,\u2014a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\u2019s name is on the chart.", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}

He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,\u2014a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\u2019s name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?\u201d \u201cNo: it is clear and concise.\u201d \u201cWell, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man\u2019s window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?\u201d \u201cVery clearly.\u201d \u201cNow, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it.

He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.\u201d \u201cBut it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\u201d \u201cQuite so. And rather to Jonathan\u2019s disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don\u2019t know that there is anything else.\u201d \u201cThe associate?\u201d \u201cAh, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\u201d \u201cFairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.\u201d \u201cThat was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man\u2019s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?\u201d \u201cI have my stick.\u201d \u201cIt is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.\u201d He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.

Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.\u201d He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket. We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where labourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent. We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight\u2019s Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment. \u201cWhat the deuce is the matter with the dog?\u201d growled Holmes. \u201cThey surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\u201d \u201cPerhaps they stood here for some time,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAh! it\u2019s all right. He\u2019s off again,\u201d said my companion, in a tone of relief. He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run. I could see by the gleam in Holmes\u2019s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey. Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson\u2019s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}

On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote. Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.", "chapter": "VII\nThe Episode of the Barrel"}
{"text": "Chapter VIII The Baker Street Irregulars \u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked. \u201cToby has lost his character for infallibility.\u201d \u201cHe acted according to his lights,\u201d said Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. \u201cIf you consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.\u201d \u201cWe must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight\u2019s Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other.\u201d There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction. \u201cWe must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from,\u201d I observed. \u201cI had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the true scent now.\u201d It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince\u2019s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water\u2019s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond. \u201cWe are out of luck,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey have taken to a boat here.\u201d Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign. Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. \u201cMordecai Smith\u201d was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, \u201cBoats to hire by the hour or day.\u201d A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept,\u2014a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression. \u201cThis looks bad,\u201d said he. \u201cThese fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.\u201d He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand. \u201cYou come back and be washed, Jack,\u201d she shouted. \u201cCome back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he\u2019ll let us hear of it.\u201d \u201cDear little chap!\u201d said Holmes, strategically. \u201cWhat a rosy-cheeked young rascal!

He gets a\u2019most too much for me to manage, \u2019specially when my man is away days at a time.\u201d \u201cAway, is he?\u201d said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. \u201cI am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been away since yesterday mornin\u2019, sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginnin\u2019 to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.\u201d \u201cI wanted to hire his steam launch.\u201d \u201cWhy, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. That\u2019s what puzzles me; for I know there ain\u2019t more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he\u2019d been away in the barge I\u2019d ha\u2019 thought nothin\u2019; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin\u2019 there he might ha\u2019 stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?\u201d \u201cHe might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\u201d \u201cHe might, sir, but it weren\u2019t his way. Many a time I\u2019ve heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don\u2019t like that wooden-legged man, wi\u2019 his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin\u2019 about here for?\u201d \u201cA wooden-legged man?\u201d said Holmes, with bland surprise. \u201cYes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that\u2019s called more\u2019n once for my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what\u2019s more, my man knew he was comin\u2019, for he had steam up in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don\u2019t feel easy in my mind about it.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear Mrs. Smith,\u201d said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cYou are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don\u2019t quite understand how you can be so sure.\u201d \u201cHis voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o\u2019 thick and foggy. He tapped at the winder,\u2014about three it would be. \u2018Show a leg, matey,\u2019 says he: \u2018time to turn out guard.\u2019 My old man woke up Jim,\u2014that\u2019s my eldest,\u2014and away they went, without so much as a word to me.

Black with a white band.\u201d \u201cAh, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs. Smith.\u2014There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it and cross the river. \u201cThe main thing with people of that sort,\u201d said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, \u201cis never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\u201d \u201cOur course now seems pretty clear,\u201d said I. \u201cWhat would you do, then?\u201d \u201cI would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the _Aurora_.\u201d \u201cMy dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.\u201d \u201cEmploy the police, then.\u201d \u201cNo. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.\u201d \u201cCould we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\u201d \u201cWorse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry.

It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet.\u201d We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes despatched his wire. \u201cWhom do you think that is to?\u201d he asked, as we resumed our journey. \u201cI am sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cYou remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, laughing. \u201cThis is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\u201d It was between eight and nine o\u2019clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure. A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper. \u201cThe energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham and eggs first.\u201d I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed \u201cMysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\u201d \u201cAbout twelve o\u2019clock last night,\u201d said the _Standard_, \u201cMr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point", "chapter": "VIII\nThe Baker Street Irregulars"}

As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\u2019s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones\u2019s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it gorgeous!\u201d said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d \u201cI think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.\u201d \u201cSo do I. I wouldn\u2019t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy.\u201d At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay. \u201cBy heaven, Holmes,\u201d I said, half rising, \u201cI believe that they are really after us.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not quite so bad as that.

There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow. \u201cGot your message, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cand brought \u2019em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.\u201d \u201cHere you are,\u201d said Holmes, producing some silver. \u201cIn future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the _Aurora_, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith\u2019s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?\u201d \u201cYes, guv\u2019nor,\u201d said Wiggins. \u201cThe old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here\u2019s a day in advance. Now off you go!\u201d He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street. \u201cIf the launch is above water they will find her,\u201d said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe. \u201cThey can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. In the meanwhile, we can do nothing but await results. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the _Aurora_ or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\u201d \u201cToby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed, Holmes?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.\u201d \u201cThat other man again!\u201d \u201cI have no wish to make a mystery of him,\u2014to you, anyway.

Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our savage?\u201d \u201cSouth American,\u201d I hazarded. He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf. \u201cThis is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here? \u2018Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay of Bengal.\u2019 Hum! hum! What\u2019s all this? Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods\u2014Ah, here we are. \u2018The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.\u2019 Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen to this. \u2018They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.\u2019 Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him.\u201d \u201cBut how came he to have so singular a companion?\u201d \u201cAh, that is more than I can tell.

Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\u201d He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,\u2014his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation.

{"text": "Chapter IX A Break in the Chain It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed. Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled. \u201cYou have slept soundly,\u201d he said. \u201cI feared that our talk would wake you.\u201d \u201cI heard nothing,\u201d I answered. \u201cHave you had fresh news, then?\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.\u201d \u201cCan I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night\u2019s outing.\u201d \u201cNo, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.\u201d \u201cThen I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester. She asked me to, yesterday.\u201d \u201cOn Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\u201d asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes. \u201cWell, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what happened.\u201d \u201cI would not tell them too much,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWomen are never to be entirely trusted,\u2014not the best of them.\u201d I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. \u201cI shall be back in an hour or two,\u201d I remarked. \u201cAll right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don\u2019t think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now.\u201d I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist\u2019s in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night\u2019s adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto\u2019s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them. \u201cIt is a romance!\u201d cried Mrs. Forrester. \u201cAn injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\u201d \u201cAnd two knight-errants to the rescue,\u201d added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me. \u201cWhy, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don\u2019t think that you are nearly excited enough.

Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\u201d It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest. \u201cIt is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge.\u201d It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home. My companion\u2019s book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none. \u201cI suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\u201d I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds. \u201cNo, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,\u201d sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, \u201cI am afraid for his health?\u201d \u201cWhy so, Mrs. Hudson?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with \u2018What is that, Mrs. Hudson?\u2019 And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he\u2019s not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don\u2019t know how ever I got out of the room.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\u201d I answered. \u201cI have seen him like this before. He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless.\u201d I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction. At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish colour upon either cheek. \u201cYou are knocking yourself up, old man,\u201d I remarked. \u201cI heard you marching about in the night.\u201d \u201cNo, I could not sleep,\u201d he answered. \u201cThis infernal problem is consuming me.

It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used every means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.\u201d \u201cOr that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\u201d \u201cNo, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.\u201d \u201cCould it have gone up the river?\u201d \u201cI have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear something.\u201d We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment. In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck. \u201cI am off down the river, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cI have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events.\u201d \u201cSurely I can come with you, then?\u201d said I. \u201cNo; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come.

If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back.\u201d I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the _Standard_, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business. \u201cWith reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\u201d it remarked, \u201cwe have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.\u201d \u201cThat is satisfactory so far as it goes,\u201d thought I. \u201cFriend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\u201d I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way: \u201cLost.\u2014Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith\u2019s Wharf at or about three o\u2019clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch _Aurora_, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith\u2019s Wharf, or at 221_b_ Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch _Aurora_.\u201d This was clearly Holmes\u2019s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband. It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing.

I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion\u2019s reasoning. Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic,\u2014his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes\u2019s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally _outr\u00e9_ and startling. At three o\u2019clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic. \u201cGood-day, sir; good-day,\u201d said he. \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.\u201d \u201cYes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\u201d \u201cThank you; I don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d said he, mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief. \u201cAnd a whiskey-and-soda?\u201d \u201cWell, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case?\u201d \u201cI remember that you expressed one.\u201d \u201cWell, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he left his brother\u2019s room he was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. It\u2019s a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.\u201d \u201cWe all need help sometimes,\u201d said I. \u201cYour friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\u201d said he, in a husky and confidential voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a man who is not to be beat.

I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I don\u2019t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message.\u201d He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was dated from Poplar at twelve o\u2019clock. \u201cGo to Baker Street at once,\u201d it said. \u201cIf I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.\u201d \u201cThis sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,\u201d said I. \u201cAh, then he has been at fault too,\u201d exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. \u201cEven the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door. Perhaps this is he.\u201d A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long grey side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty. \u201cWhat is it, my man?\u201d I asked. He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age. \u201cIs Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\u201d said he. \u201cNo; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for him.\u201d \u201cIt was to him himself I was to tell it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut I tell you that I am acting for him.

I don\u2019t care about the look of either of you, and I won\u2019t tell a word.\u201d He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him. \u201cWait a bit, my friend,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have important information, and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.\u201d The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognised the uselessness of resistance. \u201cPretty sort o\u2019 treatment this!\u201d he cried, stamping his stick. \u201cI come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!\u201d \u201cYou will be none the worse,\u201d I said. \u201cWe shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.\u201d He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk. Suddenly, however, Holmes\u2019s voice broke in upon us. \u201cI think that you might offer me a cigar too,\u201d he said. We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement. \u201cHolmes!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cYou here! But where is the old man?\u201d \u201cHere is the old man,\u201d said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \u201cHere he is,\u2014wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\u201d \u201cAh, You rogue!\u201d cried Jones, highly delighted. \u201cYou would have made an actor, and a rare one.

The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.\u201d \u201cCertainly. That is easily managed. One other point.

{"text": "Chapter X The End of the Islander Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects,\u2014on miracle-plays, on medi\u00e6val pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future,\u2014handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a _bon vivant_. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes\u2019s gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together. When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port. \u201cOne bumper,\u201d said he, \u201cto the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?\u201d \u201cI have my old service-revolver in my desk.\u201d \u201cYou had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.\u201d It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically. \u201cIs there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\u201d \u201cYes,\u2014that green lamp at the side.\u201d \u201cThen take it off.\u201d The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward. \u201cWhere to?\u201d asked Jones. \u201cTo the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson\u2019s Yard.\u201d Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us. \u201cWe ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.\u201d \u201cWe shall have to catch the _Aurora_, and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis.

{"text": "our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces,\u2014though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time\u2014as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge\u2014he could hardly leave at a moment\u2019s notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me to be a little weak,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition.\u201d \u201cNo, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o\u2019clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.\u201d \u201cBut the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\u201d \u201cQuite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would.

He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might hand the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours\u2019 notice.\u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough.\u201d \u201cIt is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman\u2019s rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth\u2014Jacobson\u2019s\u2014I learned that the _Aurora_ had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. \u2018There ain\u2019t naught amiss with her rudder,\u2019 said the foreman. \u2018There she lies, with the red streaks.\u2019 At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. \u2018I want her to-night at eight o\u2019clock,\u2019 said he,\u2014\u2018eight o\u2019clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won\u2019t be kept waiting.\u2019 They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water\u2019s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\u201d \u201cYou have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,\u201d said Jones; \u201cbut if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson\u2019s Yard, and arrested them when they came down.\u201d \u201cWhich would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week.\u201d \u201cBut you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,\u201d said I. \u201cIn that case I should have wasted my day.

I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\u201d While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul\u2019s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower. \u201cThat is Jacobson\u2019s Yard,\u201d said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side. \u201cCruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters.\u201d He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \u201cI see my sentry at his post,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut no sign of a handkerchief.\u201d \u201cSuppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\u201d said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward. \u201cWe have no right to take anything for granted,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight.\u201d \u201cThey are coming from work in the yard.\u201d \u201cDirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at them. There is no _a priori_ probability about it. A strange enigma is man!\u201d \u201cSome one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWinwood Reade is good upon the subject,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\u201d \u201cYes, it is your boy,\u201d I cried. \u201cI can see him plainly.\u201d \u201cAnd there is the _Aurora_,\u201d exclaimed Holmes, \u201cand going like the devil!

Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!\u201d She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head. \u201cShe is very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt if we shall catch her.\u201d \u201cWe _must_ catch her!\u201d cried Holmes, between his teeth. \u201cHeap it on, stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have them!\u201d We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp, steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the _Aurora_ lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the _Aurora_ thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track. \u201cPile it on, men, pile it on!\u201d cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. \u201cGet every pound of steam you can.\u201d \u201cI think we gain a little,\u201d said Jones, with his eyes on the _Aurora_. \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said I. \u201cWe shall be up with her in a very few minutes.\u201d At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the _Aurora_ had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs.

We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty _Aurora_. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat\u2019s lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man\u2014the smallest I have ever seen\u2014with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night.

Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury. \u201cFire if he raises his hand,\u201d said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat\u2019s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern. It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The _Aurora_ herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern.

There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores. \u201cSee here,\u201d said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. \u201cWe were hardly quick enough with our pistols.\u201d There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well.

{"text": "Chapter XI The Great Agra Treasure Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes. \u201cWell, Jonathan Small,\u201d said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \u201cI am sorry that it has come to this.\u201d \u201cAnd so am I, sir,\u201d he answered, frankly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.\u201d \u201cHave a cigar,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cand you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?\u201d \u201cYou seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it\u2019s cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.\u201d \u201cYou are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard.

He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.\u201d \u201cThat he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I\u2019d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don\u2019t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,\u201d he added, with a bitter smile, \u201cthat I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\u201d At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. \u201cQuite a family party,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn\u2019t take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine.

From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes\u2019s face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him. \u201cWe will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\u201d said Jones, \u201cand shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?\u201d \u201cYes, I shall drive.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?\u201d \u201cAt the bottom of the river,\u201d said Small, shortly. \u201cHum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.\u201d They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour\u2019s drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester\u2019s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab. She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks. \u201cI heard a cab drive up,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might", "chapter": "XI\nThe Great Agra Treasure"}

I have brought you a fortune.\u201d She glanced at the iron box. \u201cIs that the treasure, then?\u201d she asked, coolly enough. \u201cYes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto\u2019s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?\u201d I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously. \u201cIf I have it,\u201d said she, \u201cI owe it to you.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d I answered, \u201cnot to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.\u201d \u201cPray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\u201d said she. I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last,\u2014Holmes\u2019s new method of search, the discovery of the _Aurora_, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint. \u201cIt is nothing,\u201d she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. \u201cI am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.\u201d \u201cThat is all over,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\u201d \u201cIt would be of the greatest interest to me,\u201d she said. There was no eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win. \u201cWhat a pretty box!\u201d she said, stooping over it. \u201cThis", "chapter": "XI\nThe Great Agra Treasure"}

Where is the key?\u201d \u201cSmall threw it into the Thames,\u201d I answered. \u201cI must borrow Mrs. Forrester\u2019s poker.\u201d There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty! No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely empty. \u201cThe treasure is lost,\u201d said Miss Morstan, calmly. As I listened to the words and realised what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realise nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. \u201cThank God!\u201d I ejaculated from my very heart. She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause you are within my reach again,\u201d I said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it. \u201cBecause I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d \u201cThen I say, \u2018Thank God,\u2019 too,\u201d she whispered, as I drew her to my side.

His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box. \u201cThere goes the reward!\u201d said he, gloomily. \u201cWhere there is no money there is no pay. This night\u2019s work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\u201d \u201cMr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\u201d I said. \u201cHe will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no.\u201d The inspector shook his head despondently, however. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad job,\u201d he repeated; \u201cand so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\u201d His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud. \u201cThis is your doing, Small,\u201d said Athelney Jones, angrily. \u201cYes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cIt is my treasure; and if I can\u2019t have the loot I\u2019ll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It\u2019s been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You\u2019ll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.\u201d \u201cYou are deceiving us, Small,\u201d said Athelney Jones, sternly. \u201cIf you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.\u201d \u201cEasier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\u201d he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look. \u201cThe man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river.

However, there\u2019s no good grieving over it. I\u2019ve had ups in my life, and I\u2019ve had downs, but I\u2019ve learned not to cry over spilled milk.\u201d \u201cThis is a very serious matter, Small,\u201d said the detective. \u201cIf you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial.\u201d \u201cJustice!\u201d snarled the ex-convict. \u201cA pretty justice! Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga\u2019s darts in my hide, than live in a convict\u2019s cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.\u201d Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track. \u201cYou forget that we know nothing of all this,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cWe have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.\u201d \u201cWell, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is God\u2019s truth, every word of it.

I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well-known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen\u2019s shilling and joining the 3rd Buffs, which was just starting for India. \u201cI wasn\u2019t destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation. \u201cI was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abel White, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened to be a friend of our colonel\u2019s, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting.

Mr. Abel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home. \u201cWell, I was never in luck\u2019s way long. Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,\u2014a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson\u2019s wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abel White\u2019s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house.

Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra. \u201cAs it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city. \u201cNothing but the worst news came to us from every side,\u2014which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage. \u201cThe city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don\u2019t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place,\u2014the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it.

For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring. \u201cThe river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack. \u201cWell, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well. \u201cThe third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain.

At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step. \u201cMy first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered, \u2018Don\u2019t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.\u2019 There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow\u2019s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me. \u201c\u2018Listen to me, Sahib,\u2019 said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. \u2018You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army.

We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say. \u201c\u2018There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,\u2014with the Sepoy and with the Company\u2019s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men\u2019s day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow.

Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt. \u201c\u2018This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming. The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, Sahib?\u2019 \u201cIn Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne\u2019er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely. \u201c\u2018Consider, Sahib,\u2019 said he, \u2018that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them.

Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I am with you heart and soul,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018It is well,\u2019 he answered, handing me back my firelock. \u2018You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh.\u2019 \u201cThe rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death. \u201cSuddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction. \u201c\u2018Here they are!\u2019 I exclaimed. \u201c\u2018You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,\u2019 whispered Abdullah. \u2018Give him no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.\u2019 \u201cThe light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them. \u201c\u2018Who goes there?\u2019 said I, in a subdued voice. \u201c\u2018Friends,\u2019 came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out", "chapter": "XII\nThe Strange Story of Jonathan Small"}

He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me. \u201c\u2018Your protection, Sahib,\u2019 he panted,\u2014\u2018your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,\u2014I and my poor possessions.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What have you in the bundle?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018An iron box,\u2019 he answered, \u2018which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.\u2019 \u201cI could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over. \u201c\u2018Take him to the main guard,\u2019 said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gateway. Never was a man so compassed round with death. I remained at the gateway with the lantern. \u201cI could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit.

I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.\u201d He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded. \u201cIt was all very bad, no doubt,\u201d said he. \u201cI should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.\u201d \u201cGo on with your story,\u201d said Holmes, shortly. \u201cWell, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure. \u201cIt lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was the same which now lies open upon your table.

A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, \u2018the Great Mogul\u2019 and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats\u2019-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it. \u201cAfter we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier.

Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet. \u201cIt came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,\u2014three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others. \u201cIt was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up.

It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time. \u201cAt last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away. \u201cThe surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little party they used to make. \u201cWell, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don\u2019t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other\u2019s game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow.

Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him. \u201cOne night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. The major was raving about his losses. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s all up, Morstan,\u2019 he was saying, as they passed my hut. \u2018I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nonsense, old chap!\u2019 said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. \u2018I\u2019ve had a nasty facer myself, but\u2014\u2019 That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking. \u201cA couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him. \u201c\u2018I wish to have your advice, major,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018Well, Small, what is it?\u2019 he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips. \u201c\u2018I wanted to ask you, sir,\u2019 said I, \u2018who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Half a million, Small?\u2019 he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest. \u201c\u2018Quite that, sir,\u2014in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.\u2019 \u201c\u2018To government, Small,\u2019 he stammered,\u2014\u2018to government.\u2019 But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him. \u201c\u2018You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?\u2019 said I, quietly. \u201c\u2018Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.

When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him. \u201c\u2018This is a very important matter, Small,\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.\u2019 \u201cTwo nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern. \u201c\u2018I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,\u2019 said he. \u201cI repeated it as I had told it before. \u201c\u2018It rings true, eh?\u2019 said he. \u2018It\u2019s good enough to act upon?\u2019 \u201cCaptain Morstan nodded. \u201c\u2018Look here, Small,\u2019 said the major. \u2018We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.\u2019 He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed. \u201c\u2018Why, as to that, gentlemen,\u2019 I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, \u2018there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Hum!\u2019 said he. \u2018A fifth share! That is not very tempting.\u2019 \u201c\u2018It would come to fifty thousand apiece,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an impossibility.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nothing of the sort,\u2019 I answered. \u2018I have thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.\u2019 \u201c\u2018If there were only one,\u2019 he said. \u201c\u2018None or all,\u2019 I answered. \u2018We have sworn it.

I think we may very well trust him.\u2019 \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a dirty business,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Well, Small,\u2019 said the major, \u2018we must, I suppose, try and meet you. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Not so fast,\u2019 said I, growing colder as he got hot. \u2018I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 he broke in. \u2018What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Black or blue,\u2019 said I, \u2018they are in with me, and we all go together.\u2019 \u201cWell, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major\u2019s share as well as his own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,\u2014that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself. \u201cWell, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I\u2019ll make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again.

Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law,\u2014nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,\u2014that was my one thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto. \u201cWell, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came. I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me. \u201cTonga\u2014for that was his name\u2014was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes. \u201cHe was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,\u2014a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island.

I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions. \u201cWell, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at night. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realised the treasure, or if he still had it. I made friends with someone who could help me,\u2014I name no names, for I don\u2019t want to get any one else in a hole,\u2014and I soon found that he still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him. \u201cOne day, however, I got word that he was dying.

I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him. I\u2019d have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled. \u201cWe earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day\u2019s work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto\u2019s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto\u2019s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope\u2019s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp.

Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope\u2019s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith\u2019s launch the _Aurora_, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,\u2014for you have not done me a very good turn,\u2014but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\u201d \u201cA very remarkable account,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cA fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\u201d \u201cHe had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.\u201d \u201cAh, of course,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI had not thought of that.\u201d \u201cIs there any other point which you would like to ask about?\u201d asked the convict, affably. \u201cI think not, thank you,\u201d my companion answered. \u201cWell, Holmes,\u201d said Athelney Jones, \u201cYou are a man to be humoured, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors downstairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial.

I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\u201d \u201cI trust,\u201d said I, laughing, \u201cthat my judgment may survive the ordeal.

I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what remains for you?\u201d \u201cFor me,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthere still remains the cocaine-bottle.\u201d And he stretched his long white hand up for it.", "chapter": "XII\nThe Strange Story of Jonathan Small"}
{"text": "CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES. In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy\u2019s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines. Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship \u201cOrontes,\u201d and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air\u2014or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living.

So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile. On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom. \u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\u201d he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. \u201cYou are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination. \u201cPoor devil!\u201d he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. \u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d \u201cLooking for lodgings,\u201d I answered. \u201cTrying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d remarked my companion; \u201cyou are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.\u201d \u201cAnd who was the first?\u201d I asked. \u201cA fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.\u201d \u201cBy Jove!\u201d I cried, \u201cif he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.\u201d Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \u201cYou don\u2019t know Sherlock Holmes yet,\u201d he said; \u201cperhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.\u201d \u201cWhy, what is there against him?\u201d \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas\u2014an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.\u201d \u201cA medical student, I suppose?\u201d said I. \u201cNo\u2014I have no idea what he intends to go in for.

I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the-way knowledge which would astonish his professors.\u201d \u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in for?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\u201d \u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?\u201d \u201cHe is sure to be at the laboratory,\u201d returned my companion. \u201cHe either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels. As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t get on with him,\u201d he said; \u201cI know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t get on it will be easy to part company,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt seems to me, Stamford,\u201d I added, looking hard at my companion, \u201cthat you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow\u2019s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed about it.\u201d \u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d he answered with a laugh. \u201cHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastes\u2014it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.\u201d \u201cVery right too.\u201d \u201cYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.\u201d \u201cBeating the subjects!\u201d \u201cYes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death.

I saw him at it with my own eyes.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you say he is not a medical student?\u201d \u201cNo. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\u201d As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory. This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve found it,\u201d he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precipitated by h\u00e6moglobin, and by nothing else.\u201d Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features. \u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stamford, introducing us. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.\u201d \u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in astonishment. \u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about h\u00e6moglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?\u201d \u201cIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut practically\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don\u2019t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!\u201d He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \u201cLet us have some fresh blood,\u201d he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \u201cNow, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\u201d As he", "chapter": "I.\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES."}

You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\u201d As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar. \u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d \u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked. \u201cBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d I murmured. \u201cCriminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes\u2019 test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\u201d His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination. \u201cYou are to be congratulated,\u201d I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm. \u201cThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.\u201d \u201cYou seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\u201d said Stamford with a laugh. \u201cYou might start a paper on those lines. Call it the \u2018Police News of the Past.\u2019\u201d \u201cVery interesting reading it might be made, too,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. \u201cI have to be careful,\u201d he continued, turning to me with a smile, \u201cfor I dabble with poisons a good deal.\u201d He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids. \u201cWe came here on business,\u201d said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another", "chapter": "I.\nMR.

It\u2019s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\u201d I laughed at this cross-examination. \u201cI keep a bull pup,\u201d I said, \u201cand I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I\u2019m well, but those are the principal ones at present.\u201d \u201cDo you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\u201d he asked, anxiously. \u201cIt depends on the player,\u201d I answered. \u201cA well-played violin is a treat for the gods\u2014a badly-played one\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he cried, with a merry laugh. \u201cI think we may consider the thing as settled\u2014that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.\u201d \u201cWhen shall we see them?\u201d \u201cCall for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\u2019ll go together and settle everything,\u201d he answered. \u201cAll right\u2014noon exactly,\u201d said I, shaking his hand.

They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage", "chapter": "II.\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION."}

The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it. He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it. \u201cYou appear to be astonished,\u201d he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. \u201cNow that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\u201d \u201cTo forget it!\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201cI consider that a man\u2019s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order.

He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\u201d \u201cBut the Solar System!\u201d I protested. \u201cWhat the deuce is it to me?\u201d he interrupted impatiently; \u201cyou say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\u201d I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way\u2014 SHERLOCK HOLMES\u2014his limits. 1. Knowledge of Literature.\u2014Nil. 2. Philosophy.\u2014Nil. 3.

That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn\u2019s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI have to use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these people are my clients.\u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared.

The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it. Its somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer. \u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man\u2019s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs\u2014by each of these things a man\u2019s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\u201d \u201cWhat ineffable twaddle!\u201d I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, \u201cI never read such rubbish in my life.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes. \u201cWhy, this article,\u201d I said, pointing at it", "chapter": "II.\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION."}

I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\u201d \u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for the article, I wrote it myself.\u201d \u201cYou!\u201d \u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical\u2014so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\u201d \u201cAnd how?\u201d I asked involuntarily. \u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\u201d \u201cAnd these other people?\u201d \u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.\u201d \u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?\u201d \u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in", "chapter": "II.\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION."}

Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cYou were told, no doubt.\u201d \u201cNothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, \u2018Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.\u2019 The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d \u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind me of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.\u201d Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \u201cNo doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\u201d he observed. \u201cNow, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\u201d \u201cHave you read Gaboriau\u2019s works?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?\u201d Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \u201cLecoq was a miserable bungler,\u201d he said, in an angry voice; \u201che had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\u201d I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I said to myself,", "chapter": "II.\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION."}

I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.\u201d I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic. \u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for?\u201d I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message. \u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cBrag and bounce!\u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify his guess.\u201d The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair. \u201cFor Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter. Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him.

{"text": "CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion\u2019s theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction. \u201cHow in the world did you deduce that?\u201d I asked. \u201cDeduce what?\u201d said he, petulantly. \u201cWhy, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\u201d \u201cI have no time for trifles,\u201d he answered, brusquely; then with a smile, \u201cExcuse my rudeness.

If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.

Come on!\u201d He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one. \u201cGet your hat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wish me to come?\u201d \u201cYes, if you have nothing better to do.\u201d A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road. It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath.

My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at last, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition. \u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\u201d \u201cYou will have your data soon,\u201d I remarked, pointing with my finger; \u201cthis is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.\u201d \u201cSo it is. Stop, driver, stop!\u201d We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot. Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.

Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to come,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched.\u201d \u201cExcept that!\u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.\u201d \u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said evasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.\u201d Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \u201cWith two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,\u201d he said. Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \u201cI think we have done all that can be done,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.\u201d \u201cYou did not come here in a cab?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cNor Lestrade?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cThen let us go and look at the room.\u201d With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment. A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.

The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself. \u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.\u201d \u201cThere is no clue?\u201d said Gregson. \u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound?\u201d he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. \u201cPositive!\u201d cried both detectives. \u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual\u2014presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cRead it up\u2014you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.\u201d As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots. \u201cHe has not been moved at all?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\u201d \u201cYou can take him to the mortuary now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing more to be learned.\u201d Gregson had a stretcher", "chapter": "III.\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY"}

At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring.\u201d He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride. \u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were complicated enough before.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them?\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?\u201d \u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin\u2014bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio\u2019s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters\u2014one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.\u201d \u201cAt what address?\u201d \u201cAmerican Exchange, Strand\u2014to be left till called for. They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.\u201d \u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\u201d \u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet.\u201d \u201cHave you sent to Cleveland?\u201d \u201cWe telegraphed this morning.\u201d \u201cHow did you word your inquiries?\u201d \u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.\u201d \u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?\u201d \u201cI asked about Stangerson.\u201d \u201cNothing else?

Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner. \u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.\u201d The little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand there!\u201d He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall. \u201cLook at that!\u201d he said, triumphantly. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word\u2014 RACHE. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. \u201cThis was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.\u201d \u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\u201d asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice. \u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\u201d \u201cI really beg your pardon!\u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the little man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night\u2019s mystery.

I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\u201d As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket. \u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he remarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.\u201d Gregson and Lestrade had watched the man\u0153uvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end. \u201cWhat do you think of it, sir?\u201d they both asked. \u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\u201d There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your investigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?\u201d Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \u201cJohn Rance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\u201d Holmes took a note of the address. \u201cCome along, Doctor,\u201d he said; \u201cwe shall go and look him up.

I\u2019ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\u201d he continued, turning to the two detectives. \u201cThere has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.\u201d Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile. \u201cIf this man was murdered, how was it done?\u201d asked the former. \u201cPoison,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \u201cOne other thing, Lestrade,\u201d he added, turning round at the door: \u201c\u2018Rache,\u2019 is the German for \u2018revenge\u2019; so don\u2019t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\u201d With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.", "chapter": "III.\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY"}
{"text": "CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL. It was one o\u2019clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade. \u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.\u201d \u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning\u2014I have Gregson\u2019s word for that\u2014it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.\u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s height?\u201d \u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play.\u201d \u201cAnd his age?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\u201d \u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s nail had been trimmed.

My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey\u2014such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes\u2014in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\u201d \u201cAnd the florid face?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\u201d I passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men\u2014if there were two men\u2014into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.\u201d My companion smiled approvingly. \u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\u201d \u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\u201d My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he", "chapter": "IV.\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL."}

I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent-leathers and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible\u2014arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room\u2014or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\u201d This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. \u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come back.\u201d Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. \u201cI made my report at the office,\u201d he said. Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. \u201cWe thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\u201d the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk. \u201cJust let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\u201d Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative. \u201cI\u2019ll tell it ye from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy time is from ten at night to six in the morning.

At eleven there was a fight at the \u2018White Hart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\u2019clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher\u2014him who has the Holland Grove beat\u2014and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019. Presently\u2014maybe about two or a little after\u2014I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019 between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cYou stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\u201d my companion interrupted. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s true, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cthough how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t no sign of him nor of anyone else.\u201d \u201cThere was no one in the street?\u201d \u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a candle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece\u2014a red wax one\u2014and by its light I saw\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cYes, I know all that you saw.

Go on, though. What did you do next?\u201d Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression. \u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.\u201d \u201cWas the street empty then?\u201d \u201cWell, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The constable\u2019s features broadened into a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut never anyone so cryin\u2019 drunk as that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin\u2019 up agin the railings, and a-singin\u2019 at the pitch o\u2019 his lungs about Columbine\u2019s New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn\u2019t stand, far less help.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of a man was he?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes. John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \u201cHe was an uncommon drunk sort o\u2019 man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d ha\u2019 found hisself in the station if we hadn\u2019t been so took up.\u201d \u201cHis face\u2014his dress\u2014didn\u2019t you notice them?\u201d Holmes broke in impatiently. \u201cI should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up\u2014me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cThat will do,\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cWhat became of him?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d enough to do without lookin\u2019 after him,\u201d the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice. \u201cI\u2019ll wager he found his way home all right.\u201d \u201cHow was he dressed?\u201d \u201cA brown overcoat.\u201d \u201cHad he a whip in his hand?\u201d \u201cA whip\u2014no.\u201d \u201cHe must have left it behind,\u201d muttered my companion. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to see or hear a cab after that?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a half-sovereign for you,\u201d my companion said, standing up and taking his hat. \u201cI am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your sergeant\u2019s stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so.

{"text": "CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR. Our morning\u2019s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture. He was very late in returning\u2014so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared. \u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d he said, as he took his seat. \u201cDo you remember what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a broad idea,\u201d I remarked. \u201cOne\u2019s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\u201d \u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.\u201d \u201cI can understand.

There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen the evening paper?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair.\u201d He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road, this morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\u201d \u201cExcuse my using your name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\u201d \u201cThat is all right,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut supposing anyone applies, I have no ring.\u201d \u201cOh yes, you have,\u201d said he, handing me one. \u201cThis will do very well. It is almost a facsimile.\u201d \u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\u201d \u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat\u2014our florid friend with the square toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\u201d \u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous?\u201d \u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber\u2019s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?\u201d \u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, you can leave me to", "chapter": "V.\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR."}

He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.\u201d I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin. \u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d he said, as I entered; \u201cI have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\u201d \u201cAnd that is?\u201d I asked eagerly. \u201cMy fiddle would be the better for new strings,\u201d he remarked. \u201cPut your pistol in your pocket.

Don\u2019t frighten him by looking at him too hard.\u201d \u201cIt is eight o\u2019clock now,\u201d I said, glancing at my watch. \u201cYes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday\u2014\u2018De Jure inter Gentes\u2019\u2014published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles\u2019 head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off.\u201d \u201cWho is the printer?\u201d \u201cPhilippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very faded ink, is written \u2018Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.\u2019 I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\u201d As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it. \u201cDoes Dr. Watson live here?\u201d asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d I cried. At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment.

At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said, dropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he\u2019d say if he come \u2018ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o\u2019 times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cIs that her ring?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Lord be thanked!\u201d cried the old woman; \u201cSally will be a glad woman this night. That\u2019s the ring.\u201d \u201cAnd what may your address be?\u201d I inquired, taking up a pencil. \u201c13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\u201d \u201cThe Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes sharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes. \u201cThe gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\u201d she said. \u201cSally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\u201d \u201cAnd your name is\u2014\u2014?\u201d \u201cMy name is Sawyer\u2014hers is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her\u2014and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he\u2019s at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\u201d I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion; \u201cit clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\u201d With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. \u201cI\u2019ll follow her,\u201d he said, hurriedly; \u201cshe must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him.

It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger\u2019s \u201cVie de Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Ten o\u2019clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\u201d he cried, dropping into his chair; \u201cI have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.\u201d \u201cWhat is it then?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street, \u2018Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,\u2019 she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That\u2019s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to.

It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice and turn in.\u201d I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.", "chapter": "V.\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR."}
{"text": "CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO. The papers next day were full of the \u201cBrixton Mystery,\u201d as they termed it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:\u2014 The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased.

Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement. \u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score.\u201d \u201cThat depends on how it turns out.\u201d \u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in spite_ of their exertions. It\u2019s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers. \u2018Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l\u2019admire.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady. \u201cIt\u2019s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\u201d said my companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on. \u201c\u2018Tention!\u201d cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \u201cIn future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, we hain\u2019t,\u201d said one of the youths. \u201cI hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your wages.\u201d He handed each of them a shilling. \u201cNow, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\u201d He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street. \u201cThere\u2019s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,\u201d Holmes remarked. \u201cThe mere sight of an official-looking person seals men\u2019s lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation.\u201d \u201cIs it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face.

There he is!\u201d There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room. \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he cried, wringing Holmes\u2019 unresponsive hand, \u201ccongratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\u201d A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion\u2019s expressive face. \u201cDo you mean that you are on the right track?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\u201d \u201cAnd his name is?\u201d \u201cArthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty\u2019s navy,\u201d cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest. Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile. \u201cTake a seat, and try one of these cigars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.\u201d \u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said Holmes, gravely. \u201cLet us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result.\u201d The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement. \u201cThe fun of it is,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time.\u201d The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked. \u201cAnd how did you get your clue?\u201d \u201cAh, I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American\u2019s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson\u2019s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cby John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\u201d Gregson looked quite crest-fallen. \u201cI had no idea that you noticed that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been there?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \u201cyou should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem.\u201d \u201cTo a great mind, nothing is little,\u201d remarked Holmes, sententiously. \u201cWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description.

He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\u2019s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\u201d \u201cSmart\u2014very smart!\u201d murmured Sherlock Holmes. \u201cI next called upon Madame Charpentier,\u201d continued the detective. \u201cI found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too\u2014an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn\u2019t escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent\u2014a kind of thrill in your nerves. \u2018Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?\u2019 I asked. \u201cThe mother nodded. She didn\u2019t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter. \u201c\u2018At what o\u2019clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018At eight o\u2019clock,\u2019 she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation. \u2018His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains\u2014one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And was that the last which you saw of him?\u2019 \u201cA terrible change came over the woman\u2019s face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out the single word \u2018Yes\u2019\u2014and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone. \u201cThere was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice. \u201c\u2018No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,\u2019 she said. \u2018Let us be frank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.\u2019 \u201c\u2018God forgive you!\u2019 cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair. \u2018You have murdered your brother.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,\u2019 the girl answered firmly. \u201c\u2018You had best tell me all about it now,\u2019 I said. \u2018Half-confidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.\u2019 \u201c\u2018On your head be it, Alice!\u2019 cried her mother; and then, turning to me, \u2018I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible.

His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her daughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.\u2019 \u201c\u2018It is your wisest course,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a \u201cCopenhagen\u201d label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o\u2019clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her\u2014an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But why did you stand all this?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.\u2019 \u201cMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. \u2018Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each\u2014fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Well?\u2019 \u201c\u2018My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister.

When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.\u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,\u201d he said. \u201cI will just go after him and see what he does with himself.\u201d With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber\u2019s mysterious death.\u2019 \u201cThis statement came from Mrs. Charpentier\u2019s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d \u201cWhen Mrs. Charpentier paused,\u201d the detective continued, \u201cI saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned. \u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered. \u201c\u2018Not know?\u2019 \u201c\u2018No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.\u2019 \u201c\u2018After you went to bed?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201c\u2018When did you go to bed?\u2019 \u201c\u2018About eleven.\u2019 \u201c\u2018So your son was gone at least two hours?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Possibly four or five?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What was he doing during that time?\u2019 \u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered, turning white to her very lips. \u201cOf course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him.

When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, \u2018I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,\u2019 he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\u201d \u201cVery,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\u201d \u201cWhat is your theory, then?\u201d \u201cWell, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.\u201d \u201cWell done!\u201d said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \u201cReally, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\u201d \u201cI flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\u201d the detective answered proudly. \u201cThe young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won\u2019t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here\u2019s the very man himself!\u201d It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \u201cThis is a most extraordinary case,\u201d he said at last\u2014\u201ca most incomprehensible affair.\u201d \u201cAh, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\u201d cried Gregson, triumphantly. \u201cI thought you would come to that conclusion.

Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes. \u201cStangerson too!\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe plot thickens.\u201d \u201cIt was quite thick enough before,\u201d grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. \u201cI seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\u201d \u201cAre you\u2014are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\u201d stammered Gregson. \u201cI have just come from his room,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cI was the first to discover what had occurred.\u201d \u201cWe have been hearing Gregson\u2019s view of the matter,\u201d Holmes observed. \u201cWould you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\u201d \u201cI have no objection,\u201d Lestrade answered, seating himself. \u201cI freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.\u201d \u201cThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative. \u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said. \u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it.

The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years\u2019 experience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\u201d I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. \u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while. There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it. \u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work.

He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face. \u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?\u201d he asked. \u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, \u2018J. H. is in Europe.\u2019 There was no name appended to this message.\u201d \u201cAnd there was nothing else?\u201d Holmes asked. \u201cNothing of any importance. The man\u2019s novel, with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\u201d Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. \u201cThe last link,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cMy case is complete.\u201d The two detectives stared at him in amazement. \u201cI have now in my hands,\u201d my companion said, confidently, \u201call the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?\u201d \u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.\u201d \u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doctor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those ordinary pills?\u201d They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I remarked. \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\u201d I went downstairs", "chapter": "VII.\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS."}

Its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug. \u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\u201d \u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\u201d \u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.\u201d As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \u201cit is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it!

And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\u201d With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature\u2019s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \u201cI should have more faith,\u201d he said; \u201cI ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\u201d This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth. \u201cAll this seems strange to you,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cbecause you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\u201d Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working.

Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it?\u201d \u201cI cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\u201d remarked Lestrade. \u201cWe have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\u201d \u201cAny delay in arresting the assassin,\u201d I observed, \u201cmight give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\u201d Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought. \u201cThere will be no more murders,\u201d he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. \u201cYou can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for.

The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other\u2019s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person. \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d he said, touching his forelock, \u201cI have the cab downstairs.\u201d \u201cGood boy,\u201d said Holmes, blandly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard?\u201d he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer. \u201cSee how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.\u201d \u201cThe old pattern is good enough,\u201d remarked Lestrade, \u201cif we can only find the man to put them on.\u201d \u201cVery good, very good,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cThe cabman may as well help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\u201d I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room. \u201cJust give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\u201d he said, kneeling over his task, and never turning his head. The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he cried, with flashing eyes, \u201clet me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.\u201d The whole thing occurred in a moment\u2014so quickly that I had no time to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes\u2019 triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman\u2019s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes\u2019s grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off again and again.

It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting. \u201cWe have his cab,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt will serve to take him to Scotland Yard.

{"text": "CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN. In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery. There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth\u2014above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence\u2014complete and heart-subduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller.

For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying\u2014dying from hunger and from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder. Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me!\u201d said a childish voice reproachfully. \u201cHave I though,\u201d the man answered penitently, \u201cI didn\u2019t go for to do it.\u201d As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\u2019s care. The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion. \u201cHow is it now?\u201d he answered anxiously,", "chapter": "I.\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN."}

Where\u2019s mother?\u201d \u201cMother\u2019s gone. I guess you\u2019ll see her before long.\u201d \u201cGone, eh!\u201d said the little girl. \u201cFunny, she didn\u2019t say good-bye; she \u2018most always did if she was just goin\u2019 over to Auntie\u2019s for tea, and now she\u2019s been away three days. Say, it\u2019s awful dry, ain\u2019t it? Ain\u2019t there no water, nor nothing to eat?\u201d \u201cNo, there ain\u2019t nothing, dearie. You\u2019ll just need to be patient awhile, and then you\u2019ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you\u2019ll feel bullier.

What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got?\u201d \u201cPretty things! fine things!\u201d cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \u201cWhen we goes back to home I\u2019ll give them to brother Bob.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see prettier things than them soon,\u201d said the man confidently. \u201cYou just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though\u2014you remember when we left the river?\u201d \u201cOh, yes.\u201d \u201cWell, we reckoned we\u2019d strike another river soon, d\u2019ye see. But there was somethin\u2019 wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin\u2019, and it didn\u2019t turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and\u2014and\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t wash yourself,\u201d interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy visage. \u201cNo, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.\u201d \u201cThen mother\u2019s a deader too,\u201d cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly. \u201cYes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don\u2019t seem as though we\u2019ve improved matters.

In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death. \u201cCocks and hens,\u201d cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \u201cSay, did God make this country?\u201d \u201cIn course He did,\u201d said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question. \u201cHe made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\u201d the little girl continued. \u201cI guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It\u2019s not nearly so well done.

I guess it\u2019s never too late. You say them out, and I\u2019ll stand by and come in on the choruses.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019ll need to kneel down, and me too,\u201d she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind o\u2019 good.\u201d It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices\u2014the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh\u2014united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness.

He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves. \u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair. \u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco\u2014so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\u201d said another. \u201cFear not", "chapter": "I.\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN."}

Amen!\u201d responded the whole party. They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word \u201cRedskins\u201d was on every lip. \u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\u201d \u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the band. \u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices. \u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes. On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.

On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away. The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. \u201cThis is what they call delirium, I guess,\u201d he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood. The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons. \u201cMy name is John Ferrier,\u201d the wanderer explained; \u201cme and that little un are all that\u2019s left o\u2019 twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o\u2019 thirst and hunger away down in the south.\u201d \u201cIs she your child?\u201d asked someone. \u201cI guess she is now,\u201d the other cried, defiantly; \u201cshe\u2019s mine \u2019cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She\u2019s Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?\u201d he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \u201cthere seems to be a powerful lot of ye.\u201d \u201cNigh upon ten thousand,\u201d said one of the young men; \u201cwe are the persecuted children of God\u2014the chosen of the Angel Merona.\u201d \u201cI never heard tell on him,\u201d said the wanderer. \u201cHe appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.\u201d \u201cDo not jest at that which is sacred,\u201d said the other sternly. \u201cWe are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.\u201d The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are the Mormons.\u201d \u201cWe are the Mormons,\u201d answered his companions with one voice. \u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d \u201cWe do not know.

Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways. \u201cIf we take you with us,\u201d he said, in solemn words, \u201cit can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\u201d \u201cGuess I\u2019ll come with you on any terms,\u201d said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression. \u201cTake him, Brother Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cgive him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\u201d \u201cOn, on to Zion!\u201d cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them. \u201cYou shall remain here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\u201d", "chapter": "I.\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN."}
{"text": "CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH. This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease\u2014every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore. Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.

On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more ruddy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases.

It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness.

Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully. She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \u201cI\u2019m awful frightened,\u201d she said, naively; \u201cwhoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?\u201d \u201cThank God you kept your seat,\u201d the other said earnestly. He was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. \u201cI guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he\u2019s the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\u201d \u201cHadn\u2019t you better come and ask yourself?\u201d she asked, demurely. The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ll do so,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us.\u201d \u201cHe has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\u201d she answered, \u201che\u2019s awful fond of me.

Well, I don\u2019t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain\u2019t even a friend of ours.\u201d The young hunter\u2019s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud. \u201cThere, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said; \u201cof course, you are a friend now.

Good-bye!\u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a", "chapter": "II.\nTHE FLOWER OF UTAH."}

The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the ca\u00f1on. Good-bye, my own darling\u2014good-bye. In two months you shall see me.\u201d He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving.

{"text": "CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET. Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter\u2014so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about\u2014rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders\u2014women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness.

Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders\u2014women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one. Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart. One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation\u2014for he knew that such a visit boded him little good\u2014Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room. \u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?\u201d \u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier. \u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.\u201d \u201cAnd how have I neglected it?\u201d asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation. \u201cHave I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not\u2014\u2014?\u201d \u201cWhere are your wives?\u201d asked Young, looking round him. \u201cCall them in, that I may greet them.\u201d \u201cIt is true that I have not married,\u201d Ferrier answered. \u201cBut women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\u201d", "chapter": "III.\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET."}

I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\u201d \u201cIt is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\u201d said the leader of the Mormons. \u201cShe has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\u201d John Ferrier groaned internally. \u201cThere are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve\u2014stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? \u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.\u2019 This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.\u201d John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip. \u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested\u2014so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that?\u201d [1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred wives under this endearing epithet. Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted. \u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very young\u2014she is scarce of an age to marry.\u201d \u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, rising from his seat. \u201cAt the end of that time she shall give her answer.\u201d He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and flashing eyes. \u201cIt were better for you, John Ferrier,\u201d he thundered, \u201cthat you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!\u201d With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path. He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed. \u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice", "chapter": "III.\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET."}

Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it up somehow or another. You don\u2019t find your fancy kind o\u2019 lessening for this chap, do you?\u201d A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer. \u201cNo; of course not. I shouldn\u2019t care to hear you say you did. He\u2019s a likely lad, and he\u2019s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o\u2019 all their praying and preaching.

But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears\u2014one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them.\u201d \u201cBut we haven\u2019t opposed him yet,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIt will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\u201d \u201cLeave Utah!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d \u201cBut the farm?\u201d \u201cWe will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn\u2019t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don\u2019t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I\u2019m a free-born American, and it\u2019s all new to me. Guess I\u2019m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.\u201d \u201cBut they won\u2019t let us leave,\u201d his daughter objected. \u201cWait till Jefferson comes, and we\u2019ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don\u2019t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don\u2019t get your eyes swelled up, else he\u2019ll be walking into me when he sees you. There\u2019s nothing to be afeared about, and there\u2019s no danger at all.\u201d John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.", "chapter": "III.\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET."}

{"text": "CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE. On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart. As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.\u201d \u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a nasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\u201d John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were. \u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\u201d \u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\u201d \u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\u201d \u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her decision.\u201d During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces again.\u201d The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father. \u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is", "chapter": "IV.\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE."}

In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father. \u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\u201d His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door. \u201cLet me know when you have settled which it is to be,\u201d he said, sardonically. \u201cYou shall smart for this!\u201d Stangerson cried, white with rage. \u201cYou have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days.\u201d \u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\u201d cried young Drebber; \u201cHe will arise and smite you!\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019 hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach. \u201cThe young canting rascals!\u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them.\u201d \u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson will soon be here.\u201d \u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be.\u201d It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease. He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner.

Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:\u2014 \u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then\u2014\u2014\u201d The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape.

Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter\u2014what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence. What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound\u2014low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl. So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of", "chapter": "IV.\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE."}

Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope. \u201cGood God!\u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that.\u201d \u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.\u201d He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well?\u201d he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. \u201cYes. She does not know the danger,\u201d her father answered. \u201cThat is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\u201d John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man\u2019s leathery hand and wrung it cordially. \u201cYou\u2019re a man to be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve hit it there, pard,\u201d the young hunter answered. \u201cI have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\u2019d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet\u2019s nest. It\u2019s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o\u2019 the Hope family in Utah.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d \u201cTo-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?\u201d \u201cTwo thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\u201d \u201cThat will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house.\u201d While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done. \u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who", "chapter": "IV.\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE."}

Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.\u201d \u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier. Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. \u201cIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,\u201d he said with a sinister smile. The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head. Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity. \u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in authority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\u201d", "chapter": "IV.\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE."}

Nine to seven!\u201d \u201cSeven to five!\u201d repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her. \u201cHurry on! hurry on!\u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\u201d Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying. They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints.

They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes there?\u201d rang through the silent ravine. \u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. \u201cBy whose permission?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer. \u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel. \u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden. \u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot.

More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \u201cThey will be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives.\u201d During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen.

Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn\u2014for so it is called\u2014was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.

Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence\u2014a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him.

Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels. For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints.

Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had been. \u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember me.\u201d The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment\u2014indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation. \u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes.\u201d \u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\u201d \u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried, you say?\u201d \u201cMarried yesterday\u2014that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\u201d \u201cYes, I am off,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the", "chapter": "V.\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS."}

Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \u201cShe shall not be buried in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared. For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they", "chapter": "V.\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS."}

The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy\u2019s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation. His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies.

With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber\u2019s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe. Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter\u2019s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson\u2019s Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.", "chapter": "V.\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS."}

If you\u2019ll loose my legs I\u2019ll walk down to it. I\u2019m not so light to lift as I used to be.\u201d Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength. \u201cIf there\u2019s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,\u201d he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. \u201cThe way you kept on my trail was a caution.\u201d \u201cYou had better come with me,\u201d said Holmes to the two detectives. \u201cI can drive you,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cGood! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\u201d I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a good deal to say,\u201d our prisoner said slowly. \u201cI want to tell you gentlemen all about it.\u201d \u201cHadn\u2019t you better reserve that for your trial?\u201d asked the Inspector. \u201cI may never be tried,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look startled.

I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source. \u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou have an aortic aneurism!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what they call it,\u201d he said, placidly. \u201cI went to a doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I\u2019ve done my work now, and I don\u2019t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don\u2019t want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.\u201d The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story. \u201cDo you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\u201d the former asked. \u201cMost certainly there is,\u201d I answered. \u201cIn that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cYou are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll sit down, with your leave,\u201d the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word. \u201cThis aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I\u2019m on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.\u201d With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade\u2019s note-book, in which the prisoner\u2019s words were taken down exactly as they were uttered. \u201cIt don\u2019t much matter to you why I hated these men,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings\u2014a father and a daughter\u2014and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.

There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire. \u201cThey were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well. \u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again. \u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me.

Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behindhand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. \u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone. \u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him.

I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve. \u201cHe walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\u201d I handed him the glass, and he drank it down. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before.

This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. \u2018You hound,\u2019 he cried, shaking his stick at him; \u2018I\u2019ll teach you to insult an honest girl!\u2019 He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. \u2018Drive me to Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel,\u2019 said he. \u201cWhen I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands. \u201cDon\u2019t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief.

It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them. \u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within\u2014so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road. \u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s time to get out,\u2019 I said. \u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he. \u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who am I?\u2019 \u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me. \u201c\u2018You dog!\u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted", "chapter": "VI.\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D."}

Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow\u2019s sun rise.\u2019 He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. \u201c\u2018What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?\u2019 I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. \u2018Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.\u2019 I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless. \u201c\u2018Would you murder me?\u2019 he stammered. \u201c\u2018There is no murder,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.\u2019 \u201c\u2018It was not I who killed her father,\u2019 he cried. \u201c\u2018But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\u2019 I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. \u2018Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.\u2019 \u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead! \u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it.

There was no movement. He was dead! \u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber\u2019s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house\u2014for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk. \u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber\u2019s death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills.

It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison. \u201cI have little more to say, and it\u2019s as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That\u2019s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\u201d So thrilling had the man\u2019s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blas\u00e9_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man\u2019s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade\u2019s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account. \u201cThere is only one point on which I should like a little more information,\u201d Sherlock Holmes said at last. \u201cWho was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised?\u201d The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \u201cI can tell my own secrets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you\u2019ll own he did it smartly.\u201d \u201cNot a doubt of that,\u201d said Holmes heartily. \u201cNow, gentlemen,\u201d the Inspector remarked gravely, \u201cthe forms of the law must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him.\u201d He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.", "chapter": "VI.\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D."}
{"text": "CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION. We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done. \u201cGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\u201d Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening. \u201cWhere will their grand advertisement be now?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\u201d returned my companion, bitterly. \u201cThe question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,\u201d he continued, more brightly, after a pause. \u201cI would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.\u201d \u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. \u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said I. \u201cI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\u201d \u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you.\u201d \u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d said I. \u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself.

Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham. \u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots. \u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea.

By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist. \u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative. \u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own", "chapter": "VII.\nTHE CONCLUSION."}

I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis. \u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.\u201d \u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I cried. \u201cYour merits should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won\u2019t, I will for you.\u201d \u201cYou may do what you like, Doctor,\u201d he answered. \u201cSee here!\u201d he continued, handing a paper over to me, \u201clook at this!\u201d It was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question. \u201cThe public,\u201d it said, \u201chave lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.

{"text": "to the case in question. \u201cThe public,\u201d it said, \u201chave lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so when we started?\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!\u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d I answered, \u201cI have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser\u2014 \u201c\u2018Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\u2019\u201d", "chapter": "VII.\nTHE CONCLUSION."}
